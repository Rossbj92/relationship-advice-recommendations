0," longish post, tldr at bottom  i want to preface this post by saying i love my girlfriend, but some of her traits make her hard to love. i know she cares deeply for me as well, and recently told me she loves me back. ever since then though, it seems like we’re falling out awfully quick. we’ve been together for six months, and i don’t really know what i’m supposed to feel at this point. i know her flaws but i also many of her amazing traits. she means a lot to me and i would like some advice on if we should try and work this out gradually or if we should break it off before it gets worse.  what inspired this post is an argument we recently had about going to my sisters graduation ceremony. she said she didn’t want to go, until today, then suddenly she said she didn’t want to go again. so i start to get upset because we have to save her a ticket and if she didn’t want to go she should’ve said so before. after i get upset she says she was kidding and told me, “that’s not how an adult would’ve acted”  imo she’s placing specific standards on me, like i should act a certain way that has to fit her model of what an adult is. even though she seemed to not jokingly back out of a previous commitment. it seems like she wants me to read her mind. i’m not sure if this is a communication problem or it’s just my fault for getting upset. after the argument she says, “forget it” and hangs up the phone. i think i had sound reason for being upset because she was backing out of a commitment. please tell me if i’m in the wrong.  she has great traits and not so great ones, i’m trying to love her through the tough traits, but it can be hard. some of the good and bad include   she gets angry at me for random reasons, and will not explain why  she and i share a lot of similarities in interests, music, and humor  she expects me to know her work schedule when it changes constantly  she is very smart and hard working  she can hold grudges  she is a very kind person to strangers  doesn’t befriend women other than her best friend because girls are “too much drama” even though she can start drama with me sometimes.  she is a genuine person, and tells the truth  she seems to only like me sometimes, she loves me part time, and other times it seems like she can hate me.  when we’re together i feel amazing  it’s hard for her to take criticism without her taking it as an insult.   i think if we can stick this out it’ll be beneficial. part of me wants to believe that this is where our love is facing a hard, frustrating test. another part of me is asking if i am doing something to destroy this relationship ever since she said she loved me.   sometimes we are an amazing couple and i would do absolutely anything for her and other times she is really frustrating because it feels like she wants me to read her mind. in either instance though i want to be with her. i feel at home when i am with her. i’m not sure if it’s an issue with our communication styles or something, but i would like some help. thank you  tldr  my girlfriend of six months and i are facing tough times. she can be amazing but also very frustrating. wondering if i should stick it out with her to make this work.","(Longish post, TLDR at bottom)
I want to preface this post by saying I love my girlfriend, but some of her traits make her hard to love. I know she cares deeply for me as well, and recently told me she loves me back. Ever since then though, it seems like we’re falling out awfully quick. We’ve been together for six months, and I don’t really know what I’m supposed to feel at this point. I know her flaws but I also many of her amazing traits. She means a lot to me and I would like some advice on if we should try and work this out gradually or if we should break it off before it gets worse.

What inspired this post is an argument we recently had about going to my sisters graduation ceremony. She said she didn’t want to go, until today, then suddenly she said she didn’t want to go again. So I start to get upset because we have to save her a ticket and if she didn’t want to go she should’ve said so before. After I get upset she says she was kidding and told me, “that’s not how an adult would’ve acted”

IMO she’s placing specific standards on me, like I should act a certain way that has to fit her model of what an adult is. Even though she seemed to not jokingly back out of a previous commitment. It seems like she wants me to read her mind. I’m not sure if this is a communication problem or it’s just my fault for getting upset. After the argument she says, “forget it” and hangs up the phone. I think I had sound reason for being upset because she was backing out of a commitment. Please tell me if I’m in the wrong.

She has great traits and not so great ones, I’m trying to love her through the tough traits, but it can be hard. Some of the good and bad include:

She gets angry at me for random reasons, and will not explain why

She and I share a lot of similarities in interests, music, and humor

She expects me to know her work schedule when it changes constantly

She is very smart and hard working

She can hold grudges

She is a very kind person to strangers

Doesn’t befriend women other than her best friend because girls are “too much drama” even though she can start drama with me sometimes.

She is a genuine person, and tells the truth

She seems to only like me sometimes, she loves me part time, and other times it seems like she can hate me.

When we’re together I feel amazing

It’s hard for her to take criticism without her taking it as an insult. 

I think if we can stick this out it’ll be beneficial. Part of me wants to believe that this is where our love is facing a hard, frustrating test. Another part of me is asking if I am doing something to destroy this relationship ever since she said she loved me. 

Sometimes we are an amazing couple and I would do absolutely anything for her and other times she is really frustrating because it feels like she wants me to read her mind. In either instance though I want to be with her. I feel at home when I am with her. I’m not sure if it’s an issue with our communication styles or something, but I would like some help. Thank you

TLDR: My girlfriend of six months and I are facing tough times. She can be amazing but also very frustrating. Wondering if I should stick it out with her to make this work."
1,"i’ve been engaged to a woman  34  much younger than i  57  for 4 years, my divorce pending, which is the reason for the lengthy engagement. we used to talk on some messaging app every day, but now she’s often not available for a day or two. it’s getting fishy. i’m thinking of hiring a detective agency, but it seems a waste for just an engagement. i’m interested in your opinions.","I’ve been engaged to a woman (34) much younger than I (57) for 4 years, my divorce pending, which is the reason for the lengthy engagement.

2,"here’s my situation   in my 6th period class, there’s a really cute girl. she’s quiet, but mostly because she’s not looking to start conversation and become involved with the clowns in the class, and she’s not especially ‘popular’ either. talking to her is difficult because there’s no reason to talk to her  it’s a math class, very easy for both of us  and our teacher changes our seats very frequently.   i don’t really know many people in this class, so it’s always been my class where i’m the most quiet, not talking to anyone unless it’s necessary, and the fact that my eyes become irritated by the smell in the room doesn’t help either***.   so what should i do  i don’t have her in any of my other classes, but i think she has second lunch with me, but that wouldn’t be the time to start talking.   thanks!    *** i noticed that my eyes only become ‘blinky’ when i get fewer than 7 hours of sleep, anyone else have this  ","Here’s my situation:

3,"hey all, little help needed....or validation i’m not sure. basically, i moved overseas with my son  2  to give it a go with an ex partner who always stayed friendly with. we originally broke up mid 20_s wanting different things...nothing major happened we simply parted ways. stayed amicable and friendly since.  fast forward 10 years both still single wanting to settle down. we have mutual friends and from same area. our families are interlinked. he has always maintained his love for me, where i’ve been a little unsure. although it is the most stable relationship i was ever in and felt maybe i was immature back then...so i moved over to give it a go  big move - 20 hour flight 😮   we get on very well, have a similar intellect and good conversations. we ‘get’ one another and are very  perhaps too  comfortable around one another. he’s a great stepdad and a really wonderful partner....but...we lack something. i can’t put my finger on it,but that oomph. sex is kind of mechanical or staged and while i find him very good looking, i’m not all too sure if i’m that attracted to him  which makes me feel desperately shallow. surely all the other traits, friendship, trust, welcoming us both into his life to take care of us... willing to provide  he’s a ceo to big company  etc should overshadow that....and i’m trying. i just can’t shake this lack of chemistry. i go home for a visit next week, it’s decision time over what to do. am i crazy shallow or is this a major red flag not to ignore   we are 7 months in by the way, usually still can’t keep hands off each other at this point. not ‘accidentally’ falling asleep on the coach again  / any thoughts    please and thanks","Hey all, little help needed....or validation I’m not sure. Basically, I moved overseas with my son (2) to give it a go with an ex partner who always stayed friendly with. We originally broke up mid 20s wanting different things...nothing major happened we simply parted ways. Stayed amicable and friendly since.  Fast forward 10 years both still single wanting to settle down. We have mutual friends and from same area. Our families are interlinked.

We get on very well, have a similar intellect and good conversations. We ‘get’ one another and are very (perhaps too) comfortable around one another. He’s a great stepdad and a really wonderful partner....but...we lack something. I can’t put my finger on it,but that oomph. Sex is kind of mechanical or staged and while I find him very good looking, I’m not all too sure if I’m that attracted to him? Which makes me feel desperately shallow.

4,"i met a guy a few weeks ago and i really like him. we had our first date a few weeks ago and it was great. i really felt like i hit it off with him and he seemed attracted to me, although he did tell me he had had a string of short relationships in the past  he did not go into more detail . i clarified that i was not into hookups and he agreed with that.  afterward, we started to discuss a second date. it was delayed significantly  ~2 weeks  because we were both going through our final exams, moving out of our dorms, looking for summer work, etc. finally we agree on this weekend and he says he will get back to me with a time, then all of a sudden he says his life is a mess and he is not in a position to go on dates.  he clarified that it was not an issue with me and said he hoped to have his issues  sorted out  at some point, leaving open the possibility that maybe we could meet up again. but i think it would be foolish not to entertain the idea that this is just his way of letting me down  gently .  i told him that i would be open to meet him again if he were ever ready, but that i would not be joining a club that he is in that i would really be interested in because it would be awkward. i did this so he would not have any qualms about awkward encounters if he really did just want to cut contact with me, and he copy/pasted the message  sorry about all this.  before and after my response.   it still hurts. sometimes i worry no one will ever love me or be attracted to me and i was really excited to find someone that seemed to have a mutual feeling toward me. i feel so alone right now and i do not know what to do, i am so stupid. how do i get over this  should i take it at face value or assume he just was not attracted to me ","I met a guy a few weeks ago and I really like him. We had our first date a few weeks ago and it was great.

I clarified that I wasn't into hookups and he agreed with that.

Afterward, we started to discuss a second date. It was delayed significantly (~2 weeks) because we were both going through our final exams, moving out of our dorms, looking for summer work, etc. Finally we agree on this weekend and he says he'll get back to me with a time, then all of a sudden he says his life is a mess and he's not in a position to go on dates.

He clarified that it wasn't an issue with me and said he hoped to have his issues ""sorted out"" at some point, leaving open the possibility that maybe we could meet up again. But I think it would be foolish not to entertain the idea that this is just his way of letting me down ""gently"".

I told him that I would be open to meet him again if he were ever ready, but that I would not be joining a club that he's in that I would really be interested in because it would be awkward. I did this so he wouldn't have any qualms about awkward encounters if he really did just want to cut contact with me, and he copy/pasted the message ""Sorry about all this."" before and after my response. 

It still hurts. Sometimes I worry no one will ever love me or be attracted to me and I was really excited to find someone that seemed to have a mutual feeling toward me. I feel so alone right now and I don't know what to do, I'm so stupid. How do I get over this? Should I take it at face value or assume he just wasn't attracted to me?
