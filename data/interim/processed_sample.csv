During that time he started to develop depression due to his personal problems, and he said he needed some time off the relationship to focus on himself, and at the same time he said  that he didn't want to lose me as a friend and that I still meant a lot to him. I told him that I was afraid of seeing him with someone else, but he told me he didn't even want to be in a relationship right now. The break up really messed me up since it was the last month before finals, but I agreed to break up on good terms because I didn't want him to deal with his depression alone. We've been staying friends for almost 2 months now.
I still talk to him every day, and we still hang out almost every week. It's pretty much the same as before, minus the physical contacts. We even briefly talked about traveling together during winter break.
We never said ""I love you"" to each other when we were dating because we probably hadn't loved each other yet, but right now I still like him a lot. This weird relationship we're having is just going to keep me hopeful that we'll eventually get back together, but so far nothing really changes. It's really hard to move on since he's constantly present in my life, so now I'm really confused and I have no idea what to do.","['stay', 'friend', 'ex', 'guy', '3', 'month', 'time', 'start', 'develop', 'depression', 'personal', 'problem', 'say', 'need', 'time', 'relationship', 'focus', 'time', 'say', 'want', 'lose', 'friend', 'mean', 'lot', 'tell', 'afraid', 'see', 'tell', 'want', 'relationship', 'right', 'break', 'mess', 'month', 'final', 'agree', 'break', 'good', 'term', 'want', 'deal', 'depression', 'stay', 'friend', '2', 'month', 'talk', 'day', 'hang', 'week', 'pretty', 'minus', 'physical', 'contact', 'briefly', 'talk', 'travel', 'winter', 'break', 'say', 'love', 'date', 'probably', 'love', 'right', 'like', 'lot', 'weird', 'relationship', 'have', 'go', 'hopeful', 'eventually', 'far', 'change', 'hard', 'constantly', 'present', 'life', 'confused', 'idea']"

It's all mixed signals.,"I met this guy over the past summer and we hung out a few times over the weekends (no sex at the time). He even drove me 4h out of his way to another place that I had to be at the time. Barely kept in contact (he's a horrible texter and was preoccupied with a major exam) but we managed to meet up again in the fall (finally hooked up) and still (barely) kept in touch as I went back abroad to finish studies and he went back to work. Now he still doesn't really initiate texting but occasionally I'd get some texts saying he misses me when he's had a few to drink. I've noticed this as a pattern, he's never as openly affectionate when there is no liquid courage involved. Anyway, this guy probably is bad news...(what's worse is I'll be starting work in the same place as he is in a few months)... but I can't tell is he seriously interested or just wanting some action?

Hi all! Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really need some help! There’s a boy (17) who works in the store next door to where I (also 17) work and he’s been coming in on his breaks for the last few weeks to get food and talk to me and my coworkers. Last night, he came in for dinner about 6pm ish.  Then about 9:40 he came back in (my store closes at 10, his closed at 9) and hung out with me for 15 minutes. I really like him, he’s so sweet and really approachable and I feel like we have a lot in common. Point is, since we’ve been talking in person for at least a month, I feel like the next move is to give him my number so we can start texting/snapchatting/whatever, but I’m lost on how to do so without looking like a dork or being creepy. Any advice is appreciated!

I want to preface this post by saying I love my girlfriend, but some of her traits make her hard to love. I know she cares deeply for me as well, and recently told me she loves me back. Ever since then though, it seems like we’re falling out awfully quick. We’ve been together for six months, and I don’t really know what I’m supposed to feel at this point. I know her flaws but I also many of her amazing traits. She means a lot to me and I would like some advice on if we should try and work this out gradually or if we should break it off before it gets worse.

What inspired this post is an argument we recently had about going to my sisters graduation ceremony. She said she didn’t want to go, until today, then suddenly she said she didn’t want to go again. So I start to get upset because we have to save her a ticket and if she didn’t want to go she should’ve said so before. After I get upset she says she was kidding and told me, “that’s not how an adult would’ve acted”

IMO she’s placing specific standards on me, like I should act a certain way that has to fit her model of what an adult is. Even though she seemed to not jokingly back out of a previous commitment. It seems like she wants me to read her mind. I’m not sure if this is a communication problem or it’s just my fault for getting upset. After the argument she says, “forget it” and hangs up the phone. I think I had sound reason for being upset because she was backing out of a commitment. Please tell me if I’m in the wrong.

She has great traits and not so great ones, I’m trying to love her through the tough traits, but it can be hard. Some of the good and bad include:

She gets angry at me for random reasons, and will not explain why

She and I share a lot of similarities in interests, music, and humor

She expects me to know her work schedule when it changes constantly

She is very smart and hard working

She can hold grudges

She is a very kind person to strangers

Doesn’t befriend women other than her best friend because girls are “too much drama” even though she can start drama with me sometimes.

She is a genuine person, and tells the truth

She seems to only like me sometimes, she loves me part time, and other times it seems like she can hate me.

When we’re together I feel amazing

It’s hard for her to take criticism without her taking it as an insult. 

I think if we can stick this out it’ll be beneficial. Part of me wants to believe that this is where our love is facing a hard, frustrating test. Another part of me is asking if I am doing something to destroy this relationship ever since she said she loved me. 

Sometimes we are an amazing couple and I would do absolutely anything for her and other times she is really frustrating because it feels like she wants me to read her mind. In either instance though I want to be with her. I feel at home when I am with her. I’m not sure if it’s an issue with our communication styles or something, but I would like some help. Thank you

TLDR: My girlfriend of six months and I are facing tough times. She can be amazing but also very frustrating. Wondering if I should stick it out with her to make this work.","['19_m', 'conflict', 'feeling', 'girlfriend', '19_f', 'help', 'longish', 'post', 'tldr', 'want', 'preface', 'post', 'say', 'love', 'girlfriend', 'trait', 'hard', 'love', 'know', 'care', 'deeply', 'recently', 'tell', 'love', 'like', 'fall', 'awfully', 'quick', 'month', 'know', 'suppose', 'feel', 'point', 'know', 'flaw', 'amazing', 'trait', 'mean', 'lot', 'like', 'advice', 'try', 'work', 'gradually', 'break', 'get', 'bad', 'inspire', 'post', 'argument', 'recently', 'go', 'sister', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'say', 'want', 'today', 'suddenly', 'say', 'want', 'start', 'upset', 'save', 'ticket', 'want', 'say', 'upset', 'say', 'kid', 'tell', 'adult', 'act', 'imo', 'place', 'specific', 'standard', 'like', 'act', 'certain', 'way', 'fit', 'model', 'adult', 'jokingly', 'previous', 'commitment', 'like', 'want', 'read', 'mind', 'sure', 'communication', 'problem', 'fault', 'get', 'upset', 'argument', 'say', 'forget', 'hang', 'phone', 'think', 'sound', 'reason', 'upset', 'back', 'commitment', 'tell', 'wrong', 'great', 'trait', 'great', 'one', 'try', 'love', 'tough', 'trait', 'hard', 'good', 'bad', 'include', 'get', 'angry', 'random', 'reason', 'explain', 'share', 'lot', 'similarity', 'interest', 'music', 'humor', 'expect', 'know', 'work', 'schedule', 'change', 'constantly', 'smart', 'hard', 'work', 'hold', 'grudge', 'kind', 'person', 'stranger', 'befriend', 'woman', 'good', 'friend', 'girl', 'drama', 'start', 'drama', 'genuine', 'person', 'tell', 'truth', 'like', 'love', 'time', 'time', 'like', 'hate', 'feel', 'amazing', 'hard', 'criticism', 'take', 'insult', 'think', 'stick', 'beneficial', 'want', 'believe', 'love', 'face', 'hard', 'frustrating', 'test', 'ask', 'destroy', 'relationship', 'say', 'love', 'amazing', 'couple', 'absolutely', 'time', 'frustrating', 'feel', 'like', 'want', 'read', 'mind', 'instance', 'want', 'feel', 'home', 'sure', 'issue', 'communication', 'style', 'like', 'help', 'thank', 'tldr', 'girlfriend', 'month', 'face', 'tough', 'time', 'amazing', 'frustrating', 'wonder', 'stick', 'work']"

In my 6th period class, there’s a really cute girl. She’s quiet, but mostly because she’s not looking to start conversation and become involved with the clowns in the class, and she’s not especially ‘popular’ either. Talking to her is difficult because there’s no reason to talk to her (it’s a math class, very easy for both of us) and our teacher changes our seats very frequently. 

I don’t really know many people in this class, so it’s always been my class where I’m the most quiet, not talking to anyone unless it’s necessary, and the fact that my eyes become irritated by the smell in the room doesn’t help either***. 

So what should I do? I don’t have her in any of my other classes, but I think she has second lunch with me, but that wouldn’t be the time to start talking. 

Thanks!

Basically, I moved overseas with my son (2) to give it a go with an ex partner who always stayed friendly with. We originally broke up mid 20s wanting different things...nothing major happened we simply parted ways. Stayed amicable and friendly since.  Fast forward 10 years both still single wanting to settle down. We have mutual friends and from same area. Our families are interlinked. He has always maintained his love for me, where I’ve been a little unsure. Although it is the most stable relationship I was ever in and felt maybe I was immature back then...So I moved over to give it a go (big move - 20 hour flight 😮) 
We get on very well, have a similar intellect and good conversations. We ‘get’ one another and are very (perhaps too) comfortable around one another. He’s a great stepdad and a really wonderful partner....but...we lack something. I can’t put my finger on it,but that oomph. Sex is kind of mechanical or staged and while I find him very good looking, I’m not all too sure if I’m that attracted to him? Which makes me feel desperately shallow. Surely all the other traits, friendship, trust, welcoming us both into his life to take care of us... willing to provide (he’s a CEO to big company) etc should overshadow that....and I’m trying. I just can’t shake this lack of chemistry. I go home for a visit next week, it’s decision time over what to do. Am I crazy shallow or is this a major red flag not to ignore??

We had our first date a few weeks ago and it was great. I really felt like I hit it off with him and he seemed attracted to me, although he did tell me he had had a string of short relationships in the past (he didn't go into more detail). I clarified that I wasn't into hookups and he agreed with that.

Afterward, we started to discuss a second date. It was delayed significantly (~2 weeks) because we were both going through our final exams, moving out of our dorms, looking for summer work, etc. Finally we agree on this weekend and he says he'll get back to me with a time, then all of a sudden he says his life is a mess and he's not in a position to go on dates.

He clarified that it wasn't an issue with me and said he hoped to have his issues ""sorted out"" at some point, leaving open the possibility that maybe we could meet up again. But I think it would be foolish not to entertain the idea that this is just his way of letting me down ""gently"".

I told him that I would be open to meet him again if he were ever ready, but that I would not be joining a club that he's in that I would really be interested in because it would be awkward. I did this so he wouldn't have any qualms about awkward encounters if he really did just want to cut contact with me, and he copy/pasted the message ""Sorry about all this."" before and after my response. 

It still hurts. Sometimes I worry no one will ever love me or be attracted to me and I was really excited to find someone that seemed to have a mutual feeling toward me. I feel so alone right now and I don't know what to do, I'm so stupid. How do I get over this? Should I take it at face value or assume he just wasn't attracted to me?

10,8kpu8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kpu8h/dilemma_with_my_relationship_m/,Dilemma with my relationship [m],"So I've been thinking about this for a while and I can't seem to get anyone in my life to give me a real opinion on it, so I'll try here.

I am a uni student and I started dating my current gf like the first month of freshman year (rising junior currently). She's great, kind and loving and fits all my emotional needs and she's my best friend.

Here's the hang up. She is my first real relationship, and I'm hers as well. I'm not the player type, and I'm looking for someone I want to spend my life with. She's definitely a contender, but the thing is I'm afraid I won't be content down the road not ever playing the field and only dating one girl seriously ever.

Another element is she wants to wait until marriage for sex for religious reasons, which is totally her prerogative, but it has been a fight every step of the way to get her to do things with me (i.e. not intercourse but everything else). We've been dating for almost 2 years now, and I feel like it shouldn't really be as hard to get her to try things with me as it is, as long as I respect that religious boundary that she has set.

Now I know theoretically if we got married that would change, but how am I to know if we're sexually compatible if we never do it before marriage? I don't think that it's possible to have a thriving marriage with a dead bedroom. It could be that she actually loves sex, but it seems right now that it's very low on her priority list, where on mine it's pretty important.

So really the dilemma is should I keep in this relationship and risk not playing the field in college where it's so easy to play, or do I break up with her and risk not finding anyone I love as much as her?

TLDR: I'm a college junior guy who has had a girlfriend since freshman year (my first long term gf) who meets my emotional needs but not all my physical ones. Is it a good idea to stay with the same person all throughout college or should I break it off and play the field a little?","['dilemma', 'relationship', 'm', 'think', 'life', 'real', 'opinion', 'try', 'uni', 'student', 'start', 'date', 'current', 'gf', 'like', 'month', 'freshman', 'year', 'rise', 'junior', 'currently', 'great', 'kind', 'loving', 'fit', 'emotional', 'need', 'good', 'friend', 'here', 'hang', 'real', 'relationship', 'player', 'type', 'look', 'want', 'spend', 'life', 'definitely', 'contender', 'thing', 'afraid', 'content', 'road', 'play', 'field', 'date', 'girl', 'seriously', 'element', 'want', 'wait', 'marriage', 'sex', 'religious', 'reason', 'totally', 'prerogative', 'fight', 'step', 'way', 'thing', 'i.e.', 'intercourse', 'date', '2', 'year', 'feel', 'like', 'hard', 'try', 'thing', 'long', 'respect', 'religious', 'boundary', 'set', 'know', 'theoretically', 'get', 'marry', 'change', 'know', 'sexually', 'compatible', 'marriage', 'think', 'possible', 'thriving', 'marriage', 'dead', 'bedroom', 'actually', 'love', 'sex', 'right', 'low', 'priority', 'list', 'pretty', 'important', 'dilemma', 'relationship', 'risk', 'play', 'field', 'college', 'easy', 'play', 'break', 'risk', 'find', 'love', 'tldr', 'college', 'junior', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'freshman', 'year', 'long', 'term', 'gf', 'meet', 'emotional', 'need', 'physical', 'one', 'good', 'idea', 'stay', 'person', 'college', 'break', 'play', 'field', 'little']"

He (29) can't.  Not he won't but he can't. He says he has a connection with someone and when that connection is broken, he suddenly just stops wanting to have sex. 
We've been together for a little over a month and the sex has been mind-blowingly good. We couldn't get enough of each other. We'd do it at an average of twice a day for the length of time we've been together. 

But last week, we've been starting to have arguments. Just spats that blow up, really. I didn't think much of it but I guess he just snapped. 
Now he's confessed to me that this is apparently a pattern. That this is what constantly happens in his relationships. I couldn't help but feel somewhat trapped. I asked him if he still wanted to be together. He says yes. I ask him if he still loves me- yes. There's no problem other than the fact that he just CAN'T have sex with me now. 

He tells me that his exes have taken offense and left him for it. I asked him if he saw it as a problem and he said no, he wasn't a very sexual person to begin with. 

I am. I have needs. I feel bad for saying that but I do. I told him I'd stay anyway but I suddenly feel very unattractive and I've tried, trust me, and I just end up frustrated. I'm 23 and I'm not ready to give up on sex forever. This doesn't seem very healthy. 

I love him, Reddit. I just don't know what to do. Help me out here.

13,8kpjqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kpjqm/fighting_with_an_unofficial_girlfriend/,Fighting with an unofficial girlfriend,"Backstory: So I’m dating this girl and we love each other a lot but because she is going to have an internship abroad for 5 months, she doesn’t want to have something official yet. Our dates always went well, never fought and we even kissed a few times. We’re talking for half a year now

Main story: Now lately we started having some fights over texts and we ran into the problem of being yourself. 2 days ago this girl texted me that she bought some pretty revealing jeans, showing half her ass. Now I’m not all about that, but acted like I was alright and that this is probably a joke. 

Some texts later and I asked her why would she want to wear it and she didn’t respond to me for hours (8 hours). I was boiling inside. I then asked if she was going to answer my question and then she told me that it was a joke. I said: Funny joke, but you can make jokes like that somewhere else (I was so mad and reacted instantly). She responded with: It’s a fucking pants, how can you get so offended by that, but I guess with you, everything is possible. I got furious. I was smart and didn’t react to that.

I was hurt after reading that and didn’t text her for a day. I was expecting her to say that she’s sorry or even something else like: hey, what’s up. I never ignore her so I guessed she took my hint. She didn’t. I then saw on her twitter (she doesn’t know that I know her twitter) that she posted a screenshot of our conversation and captioned: how can someone ignore me for over a day about some fucking pants. 

I decided to text her. She was mad that I ignored her for over a day and that she couldn’t smell that I was hurt about that. We got into a pretty rough fight about how we should act like ourselves and that she doesn’t think it will be good in our future if fights like these keep happening. She didn’t know if she wanted to go on with me, but after a lot of texts and telling her how the future can hold anything. Even if she’s with another boy it can still end up like shit, but no one knows so you have to take a risk. I told her that I’m willing to take it with her. Some texts later and she told me the same. 

Now where do I go from here? I still love her deeply and she loves me. There is still almost a year until we go official and meet eachothers parents. We are both loyal to eachother, but I don’t know if it will even last until next year, because she’s still not a 100% certain. Should I care less? Should I keep going after her? I need help.

TLDR: Dating a girl and got into a few fights over texts where she can’t be herself because I take everything too serious and she hurts me. Now in the problem of being ourselves while still making things work out between us.

When I met my husband, I was very good friends with a gay man who was a prominent hair dresser.  I even moved in with him during my divorce.  

We were close.  He was a jerk at times to me but I accepted him for who he was.  When my husband came into the picture, he was very jealous of him.  He even suggested that we had sex.  RIDICULOUS.  My now husband trashed my friend and a few fights ended with my old friend hating me and my now husband. 

What happened was my now husband lost our parking pass in the apartment (YEARS ago when we were dating).  My old friend hadn't told his apartment that I was paying half the rent.  So when that was lost, my old friend became livid and said it was 500 bucks to get a replacement.  My now husband blew up and said I was extorting him and he called the apartment complex and complained.  

Between this and the fact that I became angry at my old friend --and I called the company to determine the REAL cost of this replacement -- my old friend was found out for sharing his apartment with me, when he shouldn't have been.

My now husband was thrilled that we left there and got him in trouble.  He didn't like his anger and his threats.  It was a mess.

It's been a couple of years, but my now husband saw my old friend.  (who won't speak to me and has TRASHED me to all of my old friends).  My old friend is gay and flirts with him.  And my husband tells me I should be nice to him.  Last night he said he ran into him on the street and my old friend screamed (sitting outside at an eatery)  

""i recognize that body and I recognize that big dic* ...swinging back and forth""  My husband was in workout clothes and he wears them tight.

My husband told me that he ran into him and that this happened and that the guy asked about how his ""girlfriend"" was..  and that he said that I was a vindictive woman and he would never talk to me again.

My husband said well you nearly got him kicked out of his apartment!  I said because of YOU!  You should have told him and owned it , if you are going to pretend to be friends with him....

He said that he thinks he's a piece of shit but that he was being nice because he had to.  and that he was being complimented in public.  

I said YOU caused this!  You hated him!  YOU made me end my friend hate each other.  YOU called the apartment complex because you thought i was extorted you for a parking pass!   

He said that I should just go apologize to him.... and start over.

Anyway please please tell me if this is normal behaviour. I'm doing work on my laptop and literally not 15 mins will go by without her saying something to me. And it's never anything useful. It's usually either her complaining about something, asking me something mudane or telling me random plans. It's cute and fine when I'm not doing work. But when I am it makes me wanna strangle her. Putting on headphones doesn't work as she'll text me instead. 

Before you say just tell her to stop. I have! It doesn't work. She'll keep doing it. Today I actually lied and said I had a business meeting just too go to a coffee shop to work. I have another week home that I'm dreading. Part of me wants to go back to the office and just work late everyday to do what I wanted to. 

It's this normal? Why can't she leave me alone for more than 15 mins ? When I'm at work she does it a lot less because she knows of I'm in meetings I can't reply.

My [26M] friend is starting to show interest in me. I have no clue how to react/respond. Need help!,"Long Story (short summary below):
I am 24 years old, I've never been in a relationship, never been kissed, never done anything sexual etc. I met my friend in college back in Aug. I randomly sat next to him in lab (best random decision of my life). I started liking him maybe 2 weeks into the semester. We exchanged numbers at some point and started hanging out, movies, dinner, game nights with his friends etc. 90% of the time it just seemed like we friends 10% of the time he seemed interested in me. By Jan. I got tired of guessing so I told him that I liked him, but I couldn't tell if he felt the same about me and that I was totally fine if he just wanted to be friends (I was used to it). By the way this was the first time I've ever told anyone how I felt about them. Anywho, he told me that he only seen me as a friend (kind of what I expected), and that I was one of the few people he knew that was smart enough to discuss class work with/ study with (soooo nerdy friend haha). I told him that that's what I expected and we continued being friends like before. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. I generally dress in like a band tee, jeans, converse or vans. We were going to hangout like we usually do, get food then see a movie. And I randomly decided to put on a dress. Throughout the day he he kept complimenting me and at one point said I looked sexy. I just thought he was being friendly, because we had already established that he only seen me as a friend, so I said thank you and moved on with the conversation. Well, half way through the movie he started feeling/massaging my butt. I was kind of shocked and didn't know what to do because no guy as ever done that to me before. So I just sat there and stuffed my face with popcorn to try to calm down haha. I messaged him later and asked him what that was all about, he apologised for doing it without asking and after a long conversation he told me that he likes me but he's terrible at giving girls attention in a relationship and doesn't want to hurt me so he isn't sure that we should be in a relationship. He said that I looked so good in the dress that his rational side flew out the window lol. I told him that that was fair, but to not do it again unless he had the intentions of being more than just friends because it kind of made me feel used. He apologised a million times more because he said that he likes me and never wants to make me feel like that.

Well last week he asked if we could hangout on Friday, I told him I couldn't because I was busy(was studying). He messaged me Saturday and asked if we could hangout, ended up not happening because he couldn't get out of work. On Sunday he asked if I wanted lunch, he was going to drop it off to me. Mind you the place he was going to is 20 mins in the opposite direction of his house and my house is another 15 from his. When he finally said he was on his way with the food, he asked if I just wanted to come over and hangout and eat the food at his place. He's never invited me over with it just being me by myself, it's always like game night or a party going on. So, I was like he must really want to see me. We ended up watching a movie in the living room. And he put his arm around me again and massaged my thigh this time (the jeans I had on werent very butt touching friendly). I didn't know what to do with my hands. I got enough courage to put my hand on his leg, and at times I ran my fingers across his forearm. 

Well, we are hanging out again this week, and this time we are watching a movie in his room. I plan on wearing a dress so he can feel on my butt if he wants to.

Basically I need advice on what to do while he is feeling on me. Like should I touch his leg or his arms or do nothing at all? Haha
I have no sexual experience and I'm freaking out over it because I have no clue what to do. And in the back of my head I'm always like ""is it okay if I touch him here, would he like that"" etc.


Short story:
I'm 24, I've never been in a relationship. My friend is showing interest in me and has started feeling on me while we are hanging out. I'm not sure what to do while he is doing it. 

Questions:
Should I touch his leg or his arm or lay my head on him? Etc.
Women: what do you do while a guy is feeling on you.
Men: what do you like to be done to you while you are feeling on a girl?

Around 8 years into our relationship she  saw  pictures of me hugging another woman \(it does look bad\) on holiday  at  the beginning of our  relationship and thinks I cheated on her.  After  weeks of her pestering  me and me denying it I was beyond  childish and  out of frustration I told  her I did and thought she would  then shut up  about it. I didn't  actually cheat, and I told her I  didn't cheat after  about a week when I  saw she couldn't mentally  handle that information.  Even though she  pestered me for said  information.2  years later and we are still together but theirs an air  of anxiety,  lack of trust and stress in the air. Plus she told me she  is depressed \(She suffered from depression before I met her\), I  gave  her information on how to deal with it, websites, a phone service   offered by my employer etc but she hasn't done anything about it.

Problem  is I have now gotten to the point where I am unhappy in the   relationship but do not have the panache to explain I am unhappy without   sending her into a state of depression as she's right on the edge. She   currently has a lot going on with her family so that is also taking  it's  toll, Plus she moved away from her family to be with me for my job  so  she has that over me, well that's how it feels anyway.I  can't  express how I feel without a replay of my past failings and a  reminder  how ""bad our relationship has been"" in the past. Saying that  she  wants  to stay in the marriage as she is ""happy enough"". Sex has   diminished,  once every 3 weeks or so. When it used  to be once every 3\-4   days. When I've had enough in the past  and say I'm leaving she usually  jumps back into gear, everything is  normal for a while then she begins  on the tirade of how bad our  relationship and now marriage is.

What I  am looking for from the community is advice on how to express my unhappiness in a constructed manner without the conversation falling into a childish exchange out of frustration, which  is what  happened before. At present there's a horrid negative feeling in the relationship due to her believing I was unfaithful. I do love her and care about her very much. But  I  don't see our situation changing without intervention or dare I say  it.  A fresh start.

I have a girlfriend. We didnt had sex yet, but the time is comming and I feel VERY anxious about it. 

Why?

I have a very small penis. 5.1in not bone pressed, 4.125 girth, 6.0 bone pressed. I do everything for this girl, and yet feel scared of not being able of satisfying her. I'm so afraid of loosing her. I saw the posts on /smalldickproblems and absorbed all of the worst things possible. I found suicidal guys there, depressed people, guys that got rejected over and over again and sometimes humiliated due to his Dick size. I dont want to be one of this guys.

I know that probably she wont mind it, but I'm so scared of the ""I can't feel"" thing. I'm so afraid. I'm feeling very unconfortable.

I'm a good boyfriend in general. I do everything for her. I'm romântic, attentive, respectful, careful. I love her so much that I can't even describe it all. Also, physically I'm a nice looking, good height guy. I read, watch and listen plenty of diferent culture so I have a lot to chat about with any girl.

Woman, could you advice me? What can I do to compensate my size ? I'm a good kisser/hugger, and I know a lot of oral/fingers, I hope it helps me somehow. Which positions, foreplay, can I do to make her feel good ?

Guys with similar stats, How do you work with your size?

I'm so scared guys. I know then""size doesnt matter"" thing, but all those guys getting rejected makes me feel so anxious about it.


Ps: this is gonna sound like the WEIRDEST thing ever, but I have some strange wrinkles wearing a condom and I need someone to take a look at it because I'm a virgin and dont have a clue of condom fitting . There is NO side intention on It. If anyone could help me with this, Just PM me .

24,8kosug,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kosug/about_the_friendzone/,About the friendzone,"Okay so about the friendzone, it’s such a twisted concept.


It actually doesn’t exist, except for in the heads of the people that are “stuck” in it. I have been in many situations where I was in love with someone, or someone was in love with me, and it wasn’t mutual. When we didn’t feel the same way we just talked about it. Then a decision was made, and we each had the responsibility to stick with that decision. Are we gonna be friends or are we trying a relationship, that kind of thing. 


The friendzone happens when one of the two doesn’t deal with their feelings properly, and isn’t able to truly be friends. That person usually doesn’t really have attention to the other’s feelings, because if they would have, they would see that they don’t actually want a relationship with someone that isn’t attracted to them on a romantic level.


Granted, it is hard to deal with rejection, because you make up all these plans in your head :). Well, when reality goes different than the plan, that’s life. You then have to decide: do I truly appreciate that person and do I want to spend time as friends and learn from this person, or do I take distance and spend time with my other friends.


In either case you’re amongst friends, you see?


About the awkwardness of such a conversation: it’s only awkward when you misunderstand or handle it before dealing with your own feelings. In reality you have all the time to try out these things and learn to be yourself more. It takes time to learn how to deal with situations where your expectations are different than reality. Use it.

Age range late 20’s,"I was talking to a girl on Okcupid. We exchanged some talk and as i was heading out, I left her my number and she replied with hers and to text her when I'm not busy. We chatted quite a lot. For about 5 days. She seemed very open, Messaging me first and always having things to talk about. I mentioned we should meet up. Made some plans and asked if she would be interested. She agreed and told me that she would prefer to do something in the afternoon instead of night because she had to meet up with her team. I told her that was fine and suggested a time to her. I haven't gotten a message back for almost 24 hrs now and we are suppose to be going on Monday. 

I also noticed she deactivated her account on Okcupid. I am assuming maybe she changed her mind and doesn't want to meet up anymore? 

Its odd to me that someone who was so open and always wanting to talk updating me when shes leaving and when she came back would just vanish. 
I'm so confused ugh... 

Should I just assume its over and move on?

27,8komby,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8komby/my_best_friend_28f_is_crossing_too_many_lines_for/,My best friend [28/F] is crossing too many lines for me [24/F],"Hold on tight, this will be a wild ride.

My bestie, who we'll call Liz, has really crossed some major lines in recent months. We've known each other since I was 8-9, and after drifting in and out of each other's lives, in 2016, we moved in together after I broke up with a long term partner. She had just divorced her abusive husband. We became thicker than thieves, picking up where we left off in our friendship. 

In 2017 she went to Zambia, South Africa for Peace Corps service. I knew this would change her forever. Her service was supposed to last 2 years, but she came home in late February of this year due to health issues and having suffered a terrible sexual assault while serving. While she was gone, I broke it off with my most recent long term partner of about 2 years and also experienced my own life changing events. All the while she was in Zambia, we kept in contact everyday using WhatsApp, so she was aware of everything going on in my life, as I was with hers. 

In December of 2017, she came home for a month for health reasons. I had just broken up with my long term partner, but I was still living with him while I figured out where to move. She stayed with my ex and I while she was in the states. Now, me and her are poly and pretty promiscuous naturally. We had some threesome fun with my ex while she was here. It was a great time, but it didn't change the fact I was utterly heartbroken over my ex and all the things he had done to hurt me. In hindsight, it was dumb to mess around with him after we'd broken up, but meh. Whatever, what's done is done. However, my ex and Liz remained in contact and became close friends. 

Initially, I had no real issue with this. Until two weeks before she was coming home in February, she told me she was moving in with him instead of with me like we'd originally planned. When I reacted negatively to it, she didn't really understand why I was upset she would be moving in with him if they were just friends. Okay, am I crazy? Wouldn't anyone be upset if their friend was shacking up with their ex? After making a post on /r/CasualConversation about it (using a different account), people there told me I was being selfish for being upset my friend was moving in with my ex since she had been brutally sexually assaulted and experienced the horribleness of South Africa for a year. So I decided to make peace with it and try to just get over myself. While I wasn't ok with it, I just decided not to be upset about it anymore. 

When she came back, she confessed to me that she was deeply in love with me and wanted to start a life and relationship with me. I did my best to gently tell her that would have to be in the future since I wasn't ready for another long term partnership or to change my life so drastically, yet. This really hurt her, and she claims I was callous and rude about it, even though I tried my hardest to be sensitive to her feelings. 

So we tried to just be our ole bestie friends again. But it has been strained. She then told me about a month ago that she and my ex have been physical and that things were becoming more than friendly between them. Being poly, as much as I hated their development, I tried to just accept it and move on, even though it hurt and bothered me immensely. She again, defended herself and claimed she was doing no wrong, as she claimed she did no wrong by moving in with my ex in the first place. So again, I tried to just say whatever and not be upset about it considering everything she has been through in the last year. 

Last week, I was diagnosed with herpes. When I told her, she told me I was being reckless in my lifestyle (lol, I got it from a dude going down on me, aaaand he was the only person I was fucking for a month or so.) She claimed I had changed into this awful, callous, ungrateful person. She had helped me move in December when she was supposed to be chilling out and relaxing. She has helped me with a lot of other stuff in the past. She said I am never grateful enough for these things. She thinks me being promiscuous is reckless even though when we were living together in 2016, she slept with 9 different people in the course of 3 months (not that I care the number of people anyone sleeps with, but it's hypocritical of her.) She also aired out all these grievances with me. Apparently I'm irresponsible with money, I should have a credit card, I don't take good care of myself, etc. While I'm not incredibly great with money, I pay my bills on time, I feed myself and take good care of myself. Getting herpes was unlucky, but didn't come about because I was being reckless, it just happened. I'm so confused why someone who is trying to just be my friend would want to be so involved in my life in literally every aspect. I feel she is encroaching on my life in very inappropriate ways. I told her this and she said we shouldn't talk for a month to let things cool down.

So fast forward to today. I was texting a guy I'm trying to pursue. We went on one date last week before I got diagnosed with herpes and before Liz and I stopped talking. Tonight, we were planning on going out together. He tells me that he met Liz and they went out for tea. Apparently the whole time they were out, she kept trying to talk about me. He claims he thinks she was just looking out for me and wanted to see if he was on the up and up. I feel really upset by this. Why would she go out with this guy she knows I'm interested in? I'm an adult! I can figure out if a guy is good enough for me on my own. I know he is her type, and I wouldn't necessarily care if we dated the same person casually, but this just seems fishy. I think she is attempting to get me to react or something, to break the silence *she fucking put into place.*

I am so done at this point. Line after line has been crossed. I made excuses and exceptions for her because I care for her and she has been through hell, but come on! I only have so much passiveness, I can only take so much before one line too many is crossed. I was already deeply considering cutting my ties with her, but this takes the cake. 

Basically, I am 100% planning on cutting my ties with her when she finally breaks the silence after our month ""off."" I am not looking for advice on whether or not to break off my friendship with her, but what I should even say to her when we finally talk again. I don't want to be mean, but I don't plan to be gentle. She has been incredibly selfish and walked all over me. While partially it's my fault for letting her, she also should have considered that I'm human and I have boundaries. I know I'm not perfect and I hurt her, too, but I have to do what's right for myself and make the best decision for me. 

Also, am I fucking insane? I feel like she has gaslit the shit out of me and fooled me into thinking I was being shitty for no reason over all the stuff she's done. Like, am I really in the wrong for feeling so upset?

So I’m getting ready to break my girlfriend of 7 months’ heart. I’d do it now but she and I are on vacation together. We will be driving to her house after vacay alone, and so she will be with her family for the summer when I do it which is nice. I’m considering staying with her the night we get there and then doing it the next day. Should we go on a date? Should I treat her and enjoy our last moments together? Or should I just rip the band-aid off?

The thing is, she’s such a good girlfriend and such a good friend and such an amazing woman but... honestly??? I’m not feeling it anymore and I haven’t for a little while. I wasn’t looking for something serious when she and I started dating, and now things are serious and I just don’t want to date anymore. Plain and simple. She’s done nothing to deserve this and in fact if someone called me a dumbass for breaking up with her I’d probably say “ya” but I’ve not been very happy in our relationship for a while and I am done. 

Problem is I’m her first love and I figure this might be really hard on her. I’m sure of my decision. I don’t want anyone to convince me not to do it. All I want now is advice as to how to let her down honestly, properly, and with most consideration for her feelings. Fact of the matter is I have some of my own issues to tend to, some other people to be focusing on, and myself to build up and the reason for the breakup is legitimately me and not her. So how do I tell her that? How can I make this as painless on her as possible? Although I’ve fallen out of love with her, I still care very much and want to make this easy on her. What do I do, y’all?

29,8kojer,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kojer/girlfriends_parents_dont_want_us_dating_need/,Girlfriends' parents don't want us dating. [NEED ADVICE],"First, let me provide a short background on what's happening:I am 17/M and she's 14/F \(about 15\). Nonetheless, she acts a lot more mature for her age. We are madly in love but there's a problem.. her parents don't really want her dating anybody, because she is too young. 

Ironically enough, she was born when her mother was about 15 years old. 

I understand, they probably thought what they did was a mistake and are now overprotective for their girl. Fine. But I am really nice guy \(not bragging\) when compared to others \- that's what everyone says \(from teachers at school to people that know me or my family\).

They can ask anybody and that's what people say about me. Her mother told her that she's scared that we won't be able to control ourselves and would probably end like her, so she neither supports us dating, nor denies it.

But her father... he's really strict and as soon as he found out that we were hanging out he \(nervously\) told her that she should stop hanging out with me and she should not have a boyfriend at that age..

Now my question is: what can be done to let them know that I have best intentions for her? And what can she do to prove that what she feels is indeed real and a mature decision? Actually, I'd like to know whether there's a way of finding if it is actually a mature decision as well.

Now of course, one way to do it is just to wait her turn 18 and then she can do whatever she wants, but 4 \(3\) years is not a small amount of time to wait...

We have good conversations at times, but when it comes down to actually doing anything further, things get tangled up. She obviously likes me (lots of touching my hands, sexual innuendos, bending over near me and showing off her body) and makes that very obvious. I really like that she has her stuff together, and has demonstrated good integrity as a person. I don't get why she tries so hard to be sexually attractive.

I snuck her my number because the group of people i was with were all slobbering over her and would have tripped over themselves giving her their numbers also. I felt like i was saving her from having to deal with that by being discreet. She never found it, or ignored it, and later gave me her facebook. We hung out on a short hiking trip, and afterward she made some kind of sudden move toward me. This freaked me out and i took a step back. She seemed to feel really rejected because of that. So we parted ways for the day. She wanted to hang out more, but i had too much going on. Later that day I tried to explain to her via messenger why i did that, and that i liked her body (she was trying *really* hard), but it just takes time for me to warm up to people. Especially physically. 

No response. Ghosted. She had blocked me. Or something. She never even read the messages for a week or two. So i got pissed and blocked her. Then we saw each other in person again and she said she read them. She is back at it again, flirting hard with her body. Now i don't know what to do. What is even going on?

I have no idea why i initiated saying hi to her. I started it all, and it feels like she expects me to do all the chasing because of that. I've also seen her hang around a ton of other dudes. Maybe she just likes male attention?

I mean, i went out of my way to make plans and include her in them (hiking), and i'm not seeing her do anything similar. To me, this is a sign of laziness. Does she really think i'll just bend over backwards for her because she shook her butt at me?","['girl', 'like', 'sync', 'girl', 'recently', 'move', 'apartment', 'complex', 'live', 'good', 'conversation', 'time', 'come', 'actually', 'thing', 'tangle', 'obviously', 'like', 'lot', 'touch', 'hand', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'bend', 'near', 'show', 'body', 'make', 'obvious', 'like', 'stuff', 'demonstrate', 'good', 'integrity', 'person', 'try', 'hard', 'sexually', 'attractive', 'sneak', 'number', 'group', 'people', 'slobber', 'trip', 'give', 'number', 'feel', 'like', 'save', 'have', 'deal', 'discreet', 'find', 'ignore', 'later', 'give', 'facebook', 'hang', 'short', 'hiking', 'trip', 'afterward', 'kind', 'sudden', 'freak', 'take', 'step', 'feel', 'reject', 'part', 'way', 'day', 'want', 'hang', 'go', 'later', 'day', 'try', 'explain', 'messenger', 'like', 'body', 'try', 'hard', 'take', 'time', 'warm', 'people', 'especially', 'physically', 'response', 'ghost', 'block', 'read', 'message', 'week', 'get', 'pissed', 'block', 'see', 'person', 'say', 'read', 'flirt', 'hard', 'body', 'know', 'go', 'idea', 'initiate', 'say', 'hi', 'start', 'feel', 'like', 'expect', 'chasing', 'see', 'hang', 'ton', 'dude', 'maybe', 'like', 'male', 'attention', 'mean', 'go', 'way', 'plan', 'include', 'hiking', 'see', 'similar', 'sign', 'laziness', 'think', 'bend', 'backwards', 'shake', 'butt']"

However, recently we had a discussion, and she was honest with me, saying that in the meantime she tried to have a boyfriend, but she told herself that he is by no means like me, so she broke up. She also told me that she was flirting with boys in too, but never let any of them to come close to her.



Now, even though I find this pretty normal (we weren't together that time), I still feel kinda bad hearing something like that. If it was a girl I have just met, then no issue, but I was with her in the past and recently got back.

We also have somewhat of a rule where we only have sex on special occasions, which generally means when we go on vacation together. We’ve been doing this for 3 or so years. On our last vacation, about 7 months ago, I always ended up always being on top because she wouldn’t have sex otherwise despite my wants. She promised to pay me back on our next vacation (coming in 2 weeks), so I’ve been mostly okay with it. 

Recently, we made a bit of a bet. She was going out for her birthday with her parents, turning 20. Not 21. She said she could easily get away with ordering an alcoholic drink, and me having worked in the industry told her there was no fucking way. This is something you can get criminally charged over. Winner was to perform oral first, but she up’d it to whoever wins tops first on our vacation. I thought there was a good chance I would win, so I took the bet. THEY HOWEVER CHEATED, ordering a non-alcoholic martini and lying to me. I just found out about this today when I came across a text to a friend that I admittably should have not been looking at. It sent a screenshot of the bet and read “lmao dumbass, I’m just going to order a virgin and he’ll never know. Win for me!” 

But what do I do with this information? I should not have seen the text in the first place, but I now know that she cheated on a bet on purpose to get the sex she wanted, and not what she said she’d be “making up to me” from our last vacation. Some ideas I have are
1) Play it cool, act like I never saw it, and go about our vacation pretending to be happy about what’s happening. The better man. Hope that she reciprocates the way I like after. 
2) Try to get her to admit what she did on her own by somewhat of a guilt trip, after which I can act mad and petty about what she did to get what I want. Mentioning stuff like “idk I just think it’s kinda shitty that you owed me and then made a bet to not do what you owed me”, which is pretty much how I felt before even seeing the text. 
3) Bring up the alcoholic drink bet around her parents, who for sure know she was not drinking an alcoholic beverage that night, catching her that way. 

I’d like to stress though that we are in a very happy relationship, and I don’t want to do anything that would majorly fuck with her.

So when we first started dating after the first year she cheated on me about 3 times. I of course at the time retaliated and broke up with her for someone else on Valentine’s Day (pretty messed up I know). Longer story short it didn’t work out so I went back but this time she was pregnant simpish me was just like sure I’ll be there. After that everything started to become a bit of a shitshow. She started to demand more of my time I’m talking about I’d be with her for at least a week at a time only being at my house for at least a couple of days putting everybody else on the back burner. That went on for about a year and a half. Until one day I waited outside her house for about 30 mins after I got out of school. So I just left then I get text saying she was going to throw my stuff out the window. A buddy of mine picked me up to take me over there and an argument happened so bad that the police got involved. Later that day I get texts from unknown numbers ranging from threats to statements to hurt me from my mom who passed to how she slept with other people. We ended up talking and resolving the situation. Fast forward to December of last year I got her a hotel and liquor for her birthday and on New Years I went out. Turns out she didn’t like it cuz I didn’t talk to her that day. She was hospitalized that day from what she told me afterwards. Yeah she slept with someone else but this time she was pregnant and not sure who the father was but she got an abortion. Now it hasn’t all been shit she does go out of her way to buy me stuff and do things for me, she was there for me when my mom passed. Things between us have been great lately.

First off this is a long post because I am heated and still trying to think clearly. I will try not to put a negative bias in as much as possible, but if I do just let me know and I can clarify or be more transparent. Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read through this, so here goes:

Ages: Me \(male\) \- 24, her \(female\) \- 27

2 year relationship

EDIT: tl;dr

Girlfriend gets upset over a lot of things, and the resulting argument/fight/mood can last hours or days. I am too drained to handle it well, and always end up being rude and nasty to her. What should I do about my relationship?

I think a quick list of  the biggest weaknesses in the relationship would help give some background, so here it is:

Me: Stubborn, lock people out once I get emotionally drained, very logical/try to solve problems for her/don't sympathize enough, very forward and don't like to sugarcoat things \(won't lie even for silly things, she hates that\)

Her: Feelings get hurt easily, afraid to stand up for self, low confidence, can't \(process?\) emotions well

We've had our differences in the past, but most situations will go as follows:

1. Something upsets her \(could be something small or big\) and she won't let go of it.
2. This entire time she expects me to make her feel better, but nothing I try works.
3. Eventually I get drained and will shut her out and end up being rude or nasty to her until she leaves.
4. We eventually ""work it out"", but the cycle will always repeat with some new problem.

And it's always her that gets upset initially, but I am definitely guilty of agitating the situation once it becomes one. My problem is **most of these things shouldn't be big issues at all**, and I am tired of dealing with them...Things like:

\-Being nervous about an interview

\-Me talking to a female coworker \(we used to work together\)

\-Moving to a new apartment

\- Not being cute and reciprocating when she says stuff like ""I can't wait to marry you"" etc

To clarify, some of these obviously can cause some stress and emotional response, but I don't think it's fair for it to ruin several hours of our time over. I would consider myself a very resilient person in terms of stress so I guess I just don't see it like she does, but here is the most recent example that has caused me to reach out:

We bought a new card game to play with my friend group \(which she is comfortable with even if she doesn't necessarily share the same kind of humor etc. They also like her, so literally no problems here, or have ever been here.\) It was a story telling game similar to apples to apples, and after two rounds she texted me at the table and said she felt like she would never fit in with our humor and that she was extremely embarrassed \(This has never happened with any other game we've played with the group\). I tried to comfort her by saying I enjoyed her stories and everyone liked her so it didn't matter if she shared our humor. She proceeded to tell me that I just gave her pity laughs for her stories and that they were horrible. She went to shower and I stayed down to finish the round. She rushed through and immediately ran outside \(this was my house, we don't live together\) so I got up to chase her. She ran down the street before stopping to cry on the sidewalk and told me chivalry was dead, I was a jerk for not following her upstairs, etc...This situation lasted for about an hour, with her saying she shouldn't have come over, shouldn't have bought the game and crying. I just held her until we went to sleep.

In the morning she was sad and continued to relive the whole event repeatedly, going over the same details time and time again. I held her, tried to make her laugh, tickled her, and tried to sympathize for 5 hours....And at that point I was burnt. She immediately got aggressive with me and wanted me to come make her feel better, but I didn't want to. I asked her if we could please just do something and spend our day off having fun and enjoying each others company, but she kept saying ""stop acting weird over there, I know what you're like when you are irritated"". Which obviously I was, but I've told her before it will pass quickly if we just get out of the situation. She didn't let it go, and started throwing pillows at me passive aggressively and making snarky comments that she only makes when she is upset. Eventually I had enough and told her to leave, that she ruined our day together. She cried for a while and I just ignored her until she left \(I know how horrible that is, but when I am drained I don't have ANY sympathy for those kind of rude remarks/actions\)...In total, this lasted from around 6 am\- 2pm.... I REALLY didn't want to spend my day off listening to her confidence issues for that long, I didn't mind it at first, but at some point I feel like you either need to let the issue go or do something about it, you know?

I clearly was in the wrong for reacting so poorly towards the end, but I don't think it's fair to **expect** me to make her feel better, trying should be enough. I gladly try, but after so many times where it has lasted for hours I just can't handle it anymore. She's a great girl when things are happy/going well, but our dynamic when something happens is so bad it makes me wonder if I should even continue the relationship. And if it were the occasional big fight I wouldn't mind. But she gets SOOO upset over what I would consider very minor things.

We've been together unofficially for 2 years \(about 1.5 officially because she was afraid to start anything official while she lived with her ex...\), and there are a lot of qualities I love about her, but this is starting to feel like a make it or break it thing for me. What should I do? If I am being honest I find her inability to handle some of the more minor stressful situations unattractive, and it makes me worry about what a future with her would be like.","['girlfriend', 'feel', 'well', 'good', 'match', 'hi', 'long', 'post', 'heated', 'try', 'think', 'clearly', 'try', 'negative', 'bias', 'possible', 'let', 'know', 'clarify', 'transparent', 'thank', 'advance', 'take', 'time', 'read', 'go', 'age', 'male', '24', 'female', '27', '2', 'year', 'relationship', 'edit', 'tl;dr', 'girlfriend', 'get', 'upset', 'lot', 'thing', 'result', 'argument', 'fight', 'mood', 'hour', 'day', 'drained', 'handle', 'end', 'rude', 'nasty', 'relationship', 'think', 'quick', 'list', 'big', 'weakness', 'relationship', 'help', 'background', 'stubborn', 'lock', 'people', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'logical', 'try', 'solve', 'problem', 'sympathize', 'forward', 'like', 'sugarcoat', 'thing', 'lie', 'silly', 'thing', 'hate', 'feeling', 'hurt', 'easily', 'afraid', 'stand', 'self', 'low', 'confidence', 'process', 'emotion', 'difference', 'past', 'situation', 'follow', '1', 'upset', 'small', 'big', 'let', '2', 'entire', 'time', 'expect', 'feel', 'well', 'try', 'work', '3', 'eventually', 'drain', 'shut', 'end', 'rude', 'nasty', 'leave', '4', 'eventually', 'work', 'cycle', 'repeat', 'new', 'problem', 'get', 'upset', 'initially', 'definitely', 'guilty', 'agitate', 'situation', 'problem', 'thing', 'big', 'issue', 'tired', 'deal', 'thing', 'like', '-bee', 'nervous', 'interview', '-me', 'talk', 'female', 'coworker', 'work', '-moving', 'new', 'apartment', 'cute', 'reciprocate', 'say', 'stuff', 'like', 'wait', 'marry', 'etc', 'clarify', 'obviously', 'cause', 'stress', 'emotional', 'response', 'think', 'fair', 'ruin', 'hour', 'time', 'consider', 'resilient', 'person', 'term', 'stress', 'guess', 'like', 'recent', 'example', 'cause', 'reach', 'buy', 'new', 'card', 'game', 'play', 'friend', 'group', 'comfortable', 'necessarily', 'share', 'kind', 'humor', 'etc', 'like', 'literally', 'problem', 'story', 'tell', 'game', 'similar', 'apple', 'apple', 'round', 'texte', 'table', 'say', 'feel', 'like', 'fit', 'humor', 'extremely', 'embarrassed', 'happen', 'game', 'play', 'group', 'try', 'comfort', 'say', 'enjoy', 'story', 'like', 'matter', 'share', 'humor', 'proceed', 'tell', 'give', 'pity', 'laugh', 'story', 'horrible', 'go', 'shower', 'stay', 'finish', 'round', 'rush', 'immediately', 'run', 'outside', 'house', 'live', 'get', 'chase', 'run', 'street', 'stop', 'cry', 'sidewalk', 'tell', 'chivalry', 'dead', 'jerk', 'follow', 'upstairs', 'etc', 'situation', 'last', 'hour', 'say', 'come', 'buy', 'game', 'crying', 'hold', 'go', 'sleep', 'morning', 'sad', 'continue', 'relive', 'event', 'repeatedly', 'go', 'detail', 'time', 'time', 'hold', 'try', 'laugh', 'tickle', 'try', 'sympathize', '5', 'hour', 'point', 'burn', 'immediately', 'get', 'aggressive', 'want', 'come', 'feel', 'well', 'want', 'ask', 'spend', 'day', 'have', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'company', 'keep', 'say', 'stop', 'act', 'weird', 'know', 'like', 'irritated', 'obviously', 'tell', 'pass', 'quickly', 'situation', 'let', 'start', 'throw', 'pillow', 'passive', 'aggressively', 'make', 'snarky', 'comment', 'make', 'upset', 'eventually', 'tell', 'leave', 'ruin', 'day', 'cry', 'ignore', 'leave', 'know', 'horrible', 'drain', 'sympathy', 'kind', 'rude', 'remark', 'action', 'total', 'last', '6', '2', 'p.m.', 'want', 'spend', 'day', 'listen', 'confidence', 'issue', 'long', 'mind', 'point', 'feel', 'like', 'need', 'let', 'issue', 'know', 'clearly', 'wrong', 'react', 'poorly', 'end', 'think', 'fair', 'expect', 'feel', 'well', 'try', 'gladly', 'try', 'time', 'last', 'hour', 'handle', 'anymore', 'great', 'girl', 'thing', 'happy', 'go', 'dynamic', 'happen', 'bad', 'make', 'wonder', 'continue', 'relationship', 'occasional', 'big', 'fight', 'mind', 'get', 'sooo', 'upset', 'consider', 'minor', 'thing', 'unofficially', '2', 'year', '1.5', 'officially', 'afraid', 'start', 'official', 'live', 'ex', 'lot', 'quality', 'love', 'start', 'feel', 'like', 'break', 'thing', 'honest', 'find', 'inability', 'handle', 'minor', 'stressful', 'situation', 'unattractive', 'make', 'worry', 'future', 'like']"

There's this girl I've known my entire life(14 years YES I know I am a bit too young for this whole dating thing). When we were kids we often played together because our parents have been friends since college but after a few years they didn't come that often anymore. She started school a year before me so that means she is the same age as me but a grade higher. Then one time when she finally did come over once again three years ago I noticed how truly beautiful she was. Five months ago we went skiing together and we talked a little bit about school and such. We got along really well but then the day ended and I felt really sad and empty because I knew that I wouldn't be able to talk to her for a long time again.

So the thing is I told a friend about her and he promised me not to tell anyone. You can imagine what happened in the next few days. Also he was teasing her all the time so I built up the courage to go and talk to her about this and if I should help her with that. Then my 'friend' came around, heard that I was talking about him, jumped into the conversation and my crush told me that that was weird and left. I don't know how he did it but afterwards he became friends with her and started talking frequently. Now I think that she knows everything.

I'd love to spend time with her again, it doesn't even have to be in a boyfriend girlfriend kinda way (that would be a bit of a problem anyways because in our age these so called 'relationships' don't last that long and if our families get invited to each others homes it'd get very awkward). It's just fun talking to her. I get this warm feeling all over my body and just smile although I never smile.

So, the thing is, I have no idea what to do. I just can't get her out of my head. I also don't want to fuck this whole thing up so we will never talk again. Recently I added her on Snapchat and she added me back too, I guess that's a good thing. But I already sent her two snaps and she didn't answer to either of them. Please just help me in this situation!

tl;dr: I want to be friends with my crush which is my childhood friend but I don't know how I can establish that.

41,8ko2x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ko2x4/my_girlfriend_27f_keeps_saying_she_feels/,My girlfriend (27/F) keeps saying she feels disconnected and needs more intimacy but I don't know what more I (25/M) can do,"My girlfriend is codependent (she knows it, I know it, our relationship definitely knows it). She's also an only child of codependent parents for what that's worth. No drug/alcohol abuse just unhealthy coping and communication mechanisms in a relationship that's existed since their early teens. 
Recently we closed the distance in our relationship that had been solely long distance for 3 years. She moved from The South to the Pacific Northwest to be with me. We don't live together for several reasons but I spend the night over there at least 3-4 nights a week. Not cohabiting upon her first arrival was a point of contention for a little while but it makes more sense for the strength and stability of our relationship to not at this point since I'm not financially stable and that's like the number one destroyer of relationships.

Since she's moved there have been several times when she's said she feels disconnected or a lack of intimacy even after we've spent several days/nights together. Her love language is physical touch which I admittedly have a slight aversion to (this is why it's important to NOT force your kids to hug/kiss relatives) but it's less so with her. I'd say she gets about 80-85% of the physical contact she'd like (outside of sex) and I reciprocate about 75% of the time. We cuddle in bed at night and in the morning. We cuddle on the couch. I come up behind her and hug her while she does dishes or cooks. She randomly touches me and rubs my back while I'm smoking bowls in the garage or making dinner or watching tv. I smack her butt at every chance I get. We have sex most nights and some mornings. Most days she still calls me on her way to/from work even though we have just seen or will see each other in 30 minutes or less.

I'm a pretty strong introvert and if I'm being honest at times it's hard not to feel smothered by her. I still try to give her as much of myself as I can in those moments because I know that she's far away from most of what she knows and is depending on me for comfort.  This leads to extra frustration when she tells me that she's feeling a lack of intimacy or connection because I feel like I'm giving her everything I can, including most of what she's asked for - with deep consideration for the things I'm saying no to. I'm reaching a point where I feel like her feeling disconnected/a lack of intimacy is more her problem within herself and her codependency than an actual issue with our relationship and the efforts I am/we are putting towards it. I don't really know what more I can do to fix this.

Am I wrong to feel like it's more her problem than mine at this point? How can I communicate my frustration without seeming like a dismissive jerk? Any suggestions to help her feel more validated/connected?

I was in a pretty harsh depressive state and I just... couldn't. Had no interest at all in sex for about 6 months. We'd spoken about it an awful lot, but I didn't do anything to try to fix it so we ended up breaking up.

It was pretty amicable, we've stayed friends, but recently I've had my suspicions that she wants to get back together. It kinda started new year's eve. We went out with one of her old uni mates, all got really drunk and her mate told me that my ex had spoken to her at great length about, well, how good I was in the sack when we had sex. Her workmates have also taken to calling me Jake the Peg (Old Rolf Harris sketch, Jake has a third leg) and outright said that she talks about sex with me & how happy she was quite a lot.

I know that sounds like I'm blowing my own trumpet, but that's honestly what's been said.

There's been talk between us of how good we were together and that it's a shame we broke up. We went for a pint or 3 this afternoon and she asked me if I want to get a flat with her - I'm wanting to move out of the place I'm in ATM & she wants to get a place as she's been living with her folks since we split up. She asked me if I wake up in the morning a bit relieved that I'm not waking up next to her, and I said no, I never think that. She also asked if I'm seeing a female colleague of mine and seemed a bit, well, pleased when I said I'm not and didn't want to be with my colleague.

I'm really shy when it comes to the ladies and utterly shit at reading signals so I'm not sure if she wants to try again, or have sex again or if it's all just innocent.

Any thoughts? I'm not against the idea of trying again, and certainly not against the idea of sex with her but because I'm pretty socially inept I'm not sure whether to try & instigate something, so to speak. For clarification - she is also bad at reading signals and is really shy with guys, so if she does want something like that, she'd find it difficult to say outright. I don't want to press the issue without having a better idea of what she wants as I don't want to drive her away. I should add that I still find her attractive. What do you Redditors think?

TL;DR: My ex has been acting in a way that makes me think she wants us to get back together but I'm too dumb & awkward to know if that's actually what she wants.","['38', 'm', 'ex', 'partner', '35', 'f', 'want', 'try', 'thing', 'ok', 'need', 'outside', 'perspective', 'ex', 'break', '18', 'month', 'ago', '5', 'year', 'live', 'engage', 'split', 'mainly', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'depressive', 'state', 'interest', 'sex', '6', 'month', 'spoken', 'awful', 'lot', 'try', 'fix', 'end', 'break', 'pretty', 'amicable', 'stay', 'friend', 'recently', 'suspicion', 'want', 'kinda', 'start', 'new', 'year', 'eve', 'go', 'old', 'uni', 'mate', 'get', 'drunk', 'mate', 'tell', 'ex', 'speak', 'great', 'length', 'good', 'sack', 'sex', 'workmate', 'take', 'call', 'jake', 'peg', 'old', 'rolf', 'harris', 'sketch', 'jake', 'leg', 'outright', 'say', 'talk', 'sex', 'happy', 'lot', 'know', 'sound', 'like', 'blow', 'trumpet', 'honestly', 'say', 'talk', 'good', 'shame', 'break', 'go', 'pint', '3', 'afternoon', 'ask', 'want', 'flat', 'want', 'place', 'atm', 'want', 'place', 'live', 'folk', 'split', 'ask', 'wake', 'morning', 'bit', 'relieved', 'wake', 'say', 'think', 'ask', 'see', 'female', 'colleague', 'bit', 'please', 'say', 'want', 'colleague', 'shy', 'come', 'lady', 'utterly', 'shit', 'reading', 'signal', 'sure', 'want', 'try', 'sex', 'innocent', 'thought', 'idea', 'try', 'certainly', 'idea', 'sex', 'pretty', 'socially', 'inept', 'sure', 'try', 'instigate', 'speak', 'clarification', 'bad', 'read', 'signal', 'shy', 'guy', 'want', 'like', 'find', 'difficult', 'outright', 'want', 'press', 'issue', 'have', 'well', 'idea', 'want', 'want', 'drive', 'away', 'add', 'find', 'attractive', 'redditor', 'think', 'tl;dr', 'ex', 'act', 'way', 'make', 'think', 'want', 'dumb', 'awkward', 'know', 'actually', 'want']"

I belong from a bengali, Indian family. I am in the final year of my engineering course and doing farely good in my academics as well as my other activities. I have been a conventional , typical good guy in my house until, lately, my mom discovered that I have been going out with a girl, I love, from my college. My parents wont allow me to talk about girls, let alone dating them or going out with them. I have been lying to them on several occasions when I go out with her. It is becoming a torture for me and not that I go around sleeping with her or doing anything objectionable but my parents have been extremely violent and aggressive with their words and actions whenever thay find me talking to her, texting her. Mind you, this is the girl i have fallen in love with 3 years ago and she is kinda my best friend. We are very much in love with each other. Though my girl adjusts and compromises everytime I say we cant do this or that or go out regularly, I myself as a man feel that I am unable to date her normally like every other guy out there. My parents wont even allow to talk about girls in my house. The very concept of love and dating is like a taboo for them. I cant even talk to her when my parents come back from work. I dont know what to do. I dont like lying and I love this girl. I dont know if ever I will be allowed to stay with and love this girl the way she deserves to. I will be graduating in a year. I am an ace student and I have topped all my exams. Though thus may sound a bit novice on my part, but somehow my parents' obsession with my career and their struggles in life is somewhat limiting my freedom of expression at home. I dont feel that even if i become capable and start earning and have my own establishments they will stop policing on me and controlling my whereabouts. I am tired and disgusted.

A month later i had gone out with friends and drunk texted him telling him i missed hanging out with him and was sad he never texted back. He texted back saying he was sorry he had just gotten out of a serious relationship and wasnt at the right place then but he wanted to hang out soon to talk about it. 
Once sober i decided to just let it go and move on but he texted me a few days later and we made plans to hang out thursday night. So thursday rolls around and i never hear from him.

I've been seeing this guy for about a year and a half. It's long distance (he lives ~5 hours away). Distance is hard.

He is a nice guy but now I feel like I know him better, he seems to be a fake friend who just makes relationships to take advantage of people, once he gets what he wants, he ditches them. You won't imagine what type of an a**hole he is, he's a very quiet person, and despite him being quiet, when we sit in a group of 4 friends, we're so opened with each other and we can say embarrassing stuff together, but he sits there and records what we say, so he can have a way to threaten any of us if we ever decided to disagree with him. My other friends don't know about it, but I somehow did figure this out. That's not really the only thing, I would teach him anything he needs, tell him about whatever he wants to know about, I taught him English for 5 months despite me being a non-native speaker, as he was extremely bad at it, and I helped him with a lot of tasks in his foundation year. And he shows almost no gratitude, and whenever I ask him for help WITH THE SIMPLEST THINGS, I have to ask him several times until he's convinced. Hell, I once told him to send me a song name that I liked, and he said ""well, I know the singer long time ago, I feel betrayed if you listened to it"". There is actually more bullshit than this, but I'll just end it here.

How do I stop holding on?,"The title explains everything, but she broke it off with me 3 months ago. I'm still holding onto it for whatever reason - and its eating me alive. 

The first time was a week or two after we had gotten together. Prior to that I worked my ass off to try and be with her because her mum absolutely hated my guts (racial thing - I'm a brown guy and she's asian.) 

She went to Canada with her mum and stayed over and her mum's friends place. There was a big timezone difference so prior to her leaving she told me she'd miss me a lot, so I told her I'd wait up for her so I could chat with her a little once she woke up. She was elated.

I'd hit the gym in the morning, get work done later on in the day - and then proceed to wait till about 4-5am religiously so I could catch her when she woke up over there. 

She's a really good singer and has always wanted to produce her own track. Her mum's friend's son (who was staying in the same household) was pursuing studies in music production. Naturally, everything clicked with them and for the 5 minutes she could afford to talk to me when she woke up - everything would be about him. ""He's so talented and he can do this and that""...

And then a day later she broke up with me over snapchat because she wasn't ""sure"" of things anymore. 

Stupid me tried holding on and giving myself excuses. ""Maybe when she's back she'll start to realise and stop harping about the guy."" She came back home and everything was still about him and she even told me they'd be keeping in contact to produce a track. 

But a month later and she ""woke up"" according to her. Did some thinking and realised what she had in front of her and things started going really smoothly. There were barely any hiccups for a long time - things were great and I've never felt happier. 

And then early last year she went on an overseas school trip with my really close friend. Being unable to be there with her (she was heading to China) so I told him to do me a favor and keep a lookout for her safety. He said he would.

Few days into the trip she called me and told me ""...you know, being with [close friend] really feels like being with you."" 

Came back home after the trip, asked me out for a walk and asked if we could take a break. I asked what it was for - and she told me it was so she could try something new. I asked her if it was to date [close friend]. She said yes. She also told me that my close friend felt the same way about her. The trip she was on with him only lasted 3 weeks. 

Later on in the year I was still reeling from all this and it was a really crucial year for me in school. I had to focus a little more on getting my grades up - but I still did my best to give her all my time and energy possible. Could've gotten sleep but I chose to surprise her with breakfast because I know she doesn't usually eat in the morning, and all that jazz. 

She broke up with me because of that.

Apparently she ""woke up"" again during this period but couldn't handle the fact that I was away a little more and really had to spend more time focusing on my studies. [Close friend] and her were also in the same course so they hung out a lot. Were always seen together. They had a whole class to hang out with but for some reason just stuck to each other. Her close friends felt that it wasn't right and told her to keep her distance especially after what happened recently. Heck, I told her the same thing.

Fast forward till the time I'm typing this 3 months after our breakup and the two of them are having dinner together to celebrate his birthday. And next wednesday they'll be going for their second concert together. 

I've never gotten to do either of these things with her.

So I'm stuck in this position where I'm constantly affected by the amount of time they're spending together. I feel like I should've put my foot down earlier and I obviously didn't - but everything's eating me alive. I still care about her; about everything. 

What exactly do I do?

Recently it had felt like she was hiding something from me and when I investigated further into it she was. 

She had been hiding that she was talking to an old male friend of hers about me and about the thought of having a relationship with him if things didn't follow through with me. After a bit of talking it was less her wanting to start the relationship and more just discussing it with that person. Mainly because of how she was feeling at the time which I completely understand. 

After we had that conversation we decided to give it just a bit more time between us and see if anything can get better. But that fell through as well. And after just a few days and we decided to break up. And it wasn't just a this isn't going to work out go our separate ways kind of break up. To me at least, it was a kind of bittersweet break up. 

We held each other in each other's arms and cried and talked about it for an hour and a half. I mean, this is all due to us really getting our feelings out and understanding that we both still very much love each other. It's just that we don't see a future together right now. It was probably the most heartbreaking thing I've had to admit. But now what I'm asking for opinion on is what is also the kicker in all of this. It wasn't like after that we both went home and just kind of stopped talking. 

She made it very clear and I as well, that we still wanted to have each other in our lives. We both had a significant impact in each other's lives before the relationship even started. But what feels like a real gut punch to me is that we are also roommates. 

Yeah, the person I love and that I can no longer Embrace in the way that I used to is literally 10 ft away from me in the other room. And before you say anything, no I can't move out and neither can she. We're on a lease and need each others support still. But how do I go about all this? I still love her and one day I want her back in my life like before but I don't know what I'm to do. I feel like I should just focus on my new job and take it step by step.

So she and I have been together off and on the last 1.5 years but we seemed to break through a lot of the issues we'd had a few months ago and things have been great between us since. But, I'm not interested in moving (I have kids who live with me half time and I won't leave them). So when the prospect of her moving somewhere else in order to stay in the US became a real possibility to consider, she blew up at me (in unrelated ways but I know now this is what triggered it). It basically made her feel like I don't love her enough to change my life so much to still be with her. And I guess she's right, I will choose my kids over her as painful as that choice is.

So I don't know what to do. She told me it's over and that I mistreat her. I can't accept being blamed for this and it makes me angry, but at the same time I still care about her a lot, and I want to be supportive to her while she's still trying to figure out what happens next for her, but I don't know how to approach it, especially given how much her words hurt and insulted me.","['35_m', 'gf', '30_f', 'blow', 'bc', 'offer', 'country', 'lose', 'job', 'gf', 'h1b', 'visa', 'recently', 'lose', 'job', 'look', 'job', 'city', 'luck', 'ask', 'friend', 'consider', 'job', 'city', 'understandably', 'anxious', 'circumstance', 'right', 'try', 'supportive', 'possible', 'help', 'resume', 'introduce', 'contact', 'etc', '1.5', 'year', 'break', 'lot', 'issue', 'month', 'ago', 'thing', 'great', 'interested', 'move', 'kid', 'live', 'half', 'time', 'leave', 'prospect', 'move', 'order', 'stay', 'real', 'possibility', 'consider', 'blow', 'unrelated', 'way', 'know', 'trigger', 'basically', 'feel', 'like', 'love', 'change', 'life', 'guess', 'right', 'choose', 'kid', 'painful', 'choice', 'know', 'tell', 'mistreat', 'accept', 'blame', 'make', 'angry', 'time', 'care', 'lot', 'want', 'supportive', 'try', 'figure', 'happen', 'know', 'approach', 'especially', 'give', 'word', 'hurt', 'insult']"
57,8kmqyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kmqyf/21f_struggling_to_crack_a_joke_without_upsetting/,"[21/f] Struggling to crack a joke without upsetting girlfriend (22/f), and I'm not sure where to go from here","We've known each other for about 2.5 months, 'official' for nearly 3 weeks, and I keep making jokes that I think she'll find funny, or are appropriate, and then she tells me she din't find it funny, and the conversation shifts to me apologising, things going super sombre and it seems to be happening every other day. 

As an example, tonight, she's gone out to get drunk with one of her best friends, she texts me saying 'You know whats funny? [my friend] is the one with drama tonight. 
NOT ME FOR ONCE'
I replied with 'I was gonna say, as opposed to you?', thinking she'd find it funny, because when you say not me for once, it IS technically opposed to you.
She has now left entirely, said 'that hurts' and is not going to talk to me for the rest of the night, and she says we need to have a serious talk about this in the morning. [Since I started typing this, she has said the amount of alcohol she's drunk has meant things have been taken out of context, but she does still want to talk about it tomorrow.]

As another example, one of her friends is pregnant, we are both girls, and I invited her to stay the night the other night, and when she said no, I said that was okay, we didn't want to get pregnant 4 weeks in. She told me she didn't find it funny, so I said sorry for a. scaring her (because she was shaking, since I caught her off guard) and b. making light of her friends pregnancy, which she has made clear she isn't happy about.

In person the other night, when we were discussing clothes I said I wasn't big enough for a brand she wears, and she said that hurts, when I had honestly not intended it to sound that way at all. I jumble my words a bit (which she knows), can find it hard to find the RIGHT words and can find it tricky to know what to say in response to some things.

IDK, it just feels like I'm constantly saying sorry. This can't be normal, can it? Maybe we're still getting used to each other and how we communicate, and I need to learn to joke less, but I don't think I've known of a couple to ever apologise THIS much. These 3 have all been in the past week, and I think there have been a couple more in just this week, and there have certainly been lots more before this. 

I do really like this girl, and I want it to work, but the distance, constantly saying sorry and feeling like shit when I DO mess up is starting to really make me question this tonight, and even yesterday. It IS still early days but I would feel like shit if I had to call this all off after just 3 weeks into my first real relationship.

And now, since typing this, and after the 'opposed to you' joke, she's now apologising to ME for upsetting me (which, i'm not upset, I was just frustrated with myself for constantly feeling like I've messed up)

What do?

TL;DR: Keep having to apologise to new girlfriend over things I keep thinking she'll find funny, but she doesn't. Is it normal to apologise a lot to a new partner in the early days of a relationship? If not, what can I do? We are long distance (to a degree, she lives 3 hours away and comes to me every 2 weeks or so).","['21', 'f', 'struggle', 'crack', 'joke', 'upset', 'girlfriend', '22', 'f', 'sure', 'know', '2.5', 'month', 'official', 'nearly', '3', 'week', 'make', 'joke', 'think', 'find', 'funny', 'appropriate', 'tell', 'dint', 'find', 'funny', 'conversation', 'shift', 'apologise', 'thing', 'go', 'super', 'sombre', 'happen', 'day', 'example', 'tonight', 'go', 'drunk', 'good', 'friend', 'text', 'say', 'know', 's', 'funny', 'friend', 'drama', 'tonight', 'reply', 'go', 'to', 'oppose', 'think', 'find', 'funny', 'technically', 'opposed', 'leave', 'entirely', 'say', 'hurt', 'go', 'talk', 'rest', 'night', 'say', 'need', 'talk', 'morning', 'start', 'type', 'say', 'alcohol', 'drunk', 'mean', 'thing', 'take', 'context', 'want', 'talk', 'tomorrow', 'example', 'friend', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'invite', 'stay', 'night', 'night', 'say', 'say', 'okay', 'want', 'pregnant', '4', 'week', 'tell', 'find', 'funny', 'say', 'sorry', 'a.', 'scare', 'shake', 'catch', 'guard', 'b.', 'make', 'light', 'friend', 'pregnancy', 'clear', 'happy', 'person', 'night', 'discuss', 'clothe', 'say', 'big', 'brand', 'wear', 'say', 'hurt', 'honestly', 'intend', 'sound', 'way', 'jumble', 'word', 'bit', 'know', 'find', 'hard', 'find', 'right', 'word', 'find', 'tricky', 'know', 'response', 'thing', 'idk', 'feel', 'like', 'constantly', 'say', 'sorry', 'normal', 'maybe', 'get', 'communicate', 'need', 'learn', 'joke', 'think', 'know', 'couple', 'apologise', '3', 'past', 'week', 'think', 'couple', 'week', 'certainly', 'lot', 'like', 'girl', 'want', 'work', 'distance', 'constantly', 'say', 'sorry', 'feel', 'like', 'shit', 'mess', 'start', 'question', 'tonight', 'yesterday', 'early', 'day', 'feel', 'like', 'shit', '3', 'week', 'real', 'relationship', 'type', 'opposed', 'joke', 'apologising', 'upset', 'upset', 'frustrate', 'constantly', 'feel', 'like', 'mess', 'tl;dr', 'have', 'apologise', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'thing', 'think', 'find', 'funny', 'normal', 'apologise', 'lot', 'new', 'partner', 'early', 'day', 'relationship', 'long', 'distance', 'degree', 'live', '3', 'hour', 'away', 'come', '2', 'week']"

We're very friendly with each other and laugh and joke about everything. Working with him is really fun. Anyways 10 mins after we close up we're standing outside just talking near my car before I left. Got in my car and saw tons of missed calls and messages from my boyfriend, apparently he drove by and saw me talking to him and was pissed (even though I work with him and talk to him all day long) but I get it, I didn't HAVE TO talk to him after work like I do when we're on the clock so I apologized and he's been cranky about it but moving on since. 

Well this all happened yesterday and it really got me thinking because he keeps calling me a hypocrite because when we first started dating I didn't want him talking to his ex because she always sent him sexual memes which I didn't think was cool. Now he's calling me a hypocrite because I'm talking to my ex. Keep in mind his one ex he's taking about is the only one I've ever had an issue with. He invites his other ex's to parties we throw and one of them stayed over a few times and slept with us in our bed (which I was fine with). I just don't think it's fair that he's calling me all these names and saying I'd leave him if he did that to me when he HAS done it to me and I didn't even bat an eye. Sorry this is long I just don't know anymore. I might move back in with my mom

Tl;dr: boyfriend calling me a hypocrite for making him stop talking to one of his ex's while I still talk to mine.

She now wants to get a ribbon tattoo and I think it's a little much.","So my wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for some time. A few weeks ago we got a positive test (yay!) She was head over heels and I tried not to get too excited until we had it confirmed by a doctor. The next day she got her period and tests went negative. She was extremely upset and I can totally understand why... over the last few weeks she's had bouts of depression about it, again I totally understand and I've been there to support her through it. Well this morning she told me she wants to get a ribbon tattoo in memory of it... I love my wife and want to support her but this seems a little much. If she was truly pregnant it was for one day. I just feel like this might make things worse, having it constantly remind her as opposed to just moving on and keep trying. I also feel it's a little disrespectful to women who lost pregnancies after months (and therefore a lot more heart breaking). Not sure what to do. Do I support her in getting it? Or do I sit her down and tell her I don't agree?


EDIT: Wow, so this really exploded over the weekend. Sorry I wasn't able to respond sooner. Thank you everyone for the advice. Obviously, many people have different opinions on this subject and that's exactly why I posted here. I believe as a man it's very hard to emphasize how my wife's feeling. It's her body and I can't possibly fathom the emotional turmoil she goes through on this adventure. But of course I want to support her.

I told her how I felt about the tattoo, but that I would 100% support her if she chooses to go through with it. I simply asked that she waited a little while and see how she felt. She agreed. Since posting, she seems to still want to do it, and that's 100% fine but she's still thinking about it. Someone commented about getting her a charm bracelet and I think that's an amazing idea! I think I may get her one with a single charm (either a heart of a mountain) so that we can document the highs and lows of this adventure. We're in it together. Like many SO's, my partner deserves the world and I don't deserve her. She's amazing in every way and I will support her no matter what. She makes me a better person and I want to be there for her even in the worst of times.

61,8kmfra,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kmfra/how_do_i_unfall_in_love_w_my_best_friend_while/,"How do I ""unfall"" in love w my best friend while maintaining the bff status","Hey I(19M) think I've been in love with my best friend(19F)  for a long time (maybe 1 year?)since I lost interest with this girl I once liked, (btw my best friend helped me forget about her).
Since then, I never get interested with other girls, they only look appealing to me for only 3 seconds and after that, that feeling goes away. I've been struggling with that thing for a long time and I cannot unfall in love with the best friend. 
Fyi, my best friend(lets call her emily) is like the best girl in the world. She always put her friends' happiness above her, which most of the time it ended up hurting her back and I'll be the one who's going to confront her and all. She's also a happy go lucky girl but when she's down, everyone is going to freak out, but since we became so close, before she does stupid things, she comes to me first.

The messed up thing is that she always have these scandals with other men, and her girl friends sometimes introduce other men to her, and she will talk about them with me, to see my povs and stuff, so I will have to put on my fake ""I'm not hurt"" masks on my face. There's this one guy, he is some sort of my friend because we hang out maybe 3-4 times before. He was kind, cool, handsome and all the good stuff. (Lets say the name is harry).He is like the closest one to be her next boyfriend, and I am the middle guy over there, its stupid because I was the one who told her all the good stuff about harry. Because she and I talk about literally everything, she of course would tell me about how sweet the guy was on their dates and the little cute things he say on socmed to her. I had to say shit like ""Awwww"" and ""Dayum"" to pretend that I am so glad they have something going on now, you know because he's a good guy and all. After all, I only want good guys to date her, not douchebags.

Also, I told her many times that I don't want to date anyone for the time being because dating is a waste of time and money, but the truth is, I can't really date anyone just because of this feeling that I want to have but I can't. I also told her that she wasn't my type so that she wouldn't think that I maybe have feelings for her, that's why I think she would feel free talking about literally everything(inc periods) with me. Plus, we always hang out together like couples, and do stuff that couples do, like watching movies together, sharing drinks and ice creams, and etc. Even our friends thought that we were couples and of course, both of us would deny that, and then after that they would say things like ""I ship you guys"" or ""You guys would make a great couple""

So the dilemma I was having is, If I come clean and tell her about my feelings, I'm afraid that the strong friendship that we have built would be crushed and everything would be awkward after that. And I can't expect the opposite because she clearly(like really) don't have feelings for me. I mean like I know her very very well, what she likes and doesn't, the body language, dark pasts and everything. So I am asking you, how do I not fall in love with her and start having pleasure liking somebody else? Btw I tried not facetiming everyday or send less memes or also do less texting, but then she would acknowledge the difference right away and would beg to tell me what's wrong and ask if I'm okay and if I have something to talk about. So there's no way out then.. thanks btw if you are reading this. Please help me because this toxic feeling is eating myself slowly.

Things were always great. She blindsided me when she dumped me for work and her own personal reasons \(basically I didn't screw things up, there was no building anonymity. I was kind of annoyed she didn't give it a chance to work\) . About a year later we reconnected and started hanging out \(albeit a lot less than when we were dating\). 

After about 3 months of this I caught the same feelings I had before & brought up giving ""us"" as it were another shot. She says she loves the time we spend together but isn't in a position to be in a real relationship. She left the door open for the future but wouldn't/couldn't be concrete in terms of when or what would need to happen before we could revisit things. Basically she wanted to keep hanging out and see how things went.

I decided I was ok with seeing how things went and sort of playing it cool. Now it's been 6 months since our conversation. Some times things are great: dinner dates, hanging out, etc. Other times I don't hear from her for an entire week & then I'll see her but only for an hour before she has to go back to work or whatever.

I've now reached the point where I fear that this may be all she will ever want. If that's the case then I think I need to move on. I love this girl but if she's the type that will never take things seriously then I don't see having the family that I want. However, if she really does just need time to get her career on track before she gets into a relationship I understand that & I don't mind taking things slowly for now.

My question is should I try to have this conversation with her one last time? Or just move on knowing that last time I tried to bring it up she was not really that open to discussing it. I hate the idea of ultimatums or hard time tables but I just wish I knew what her plan/vision for us was. I assume the fact that she can't communicate this means that she has no interest and never will but is this too much of an assumption?

I'm tired of the grey area. I'd be ok with it if I knew say once she saved up enough to stop renting she'd be ready or whatever her marker was. It's that fact that there is no marker that makes me think she might be playing me.","['girl', 'f/27', 'm/27', 'seeing', 'ready', 'relationship', 'right', 'date', '2', 'year', 'thing', 'great', 'blindside', 'dump', 'work', 'personal', 'reason', 'basically', 'screw', 'thing', 'building', 'anonymity', 'kind', 'annoy', 'chance', 'work', 'year', 'later', 'reconnecte', 'start', 'hang', 'albeit', 'lot', 'date', '3', 'month', 'catch', 'feeling', 'bring', 'give', 'shot', 'say', 'love', 'time', 'spend', 'position', 'real', 'relationship', 'leave', 'door', 'open', 'future', 'concrete', 'term', 'need', 'happen', 'revisit', 'thing', 'basically', 'want', 'hang', 'thing', 'go', 'decide', 'ok', 'see', 'thing', 'go', 'sort', 'play', 'cool', '6', 'month', 'conversation', 'time', 'thing', 'great', 'dinner', 'date', 'hang', 'etc', 'time', 'hear', 'entire', 'week', 'hour', 'work', 'reach', 'point', 'fear', 'want', 'case', 'think', 'need', 'love', 'girl', 'type', 'thing', 'seriously', 'have', 'family', 'want', 'need', 'time', 'career', 'track', 'get', 'relationship', 'understand', 'mind', 'take', 'thing', 'slowly', 'question', 'try', 'conversation', 'time', 'know', 'time', 'try', 'bring', 'open', 'discuss', 'hate', 'idea', 'ultimatum', 'hard', 'time', 'table', 'wish', 'know', 'plan', 'vision', 'assume', 'fact', 'communicate', 'mean', 'interest', 'assumption', 'tired', 'grey', 'area', 'ok', 'know', 'save', 'stop', 'rent', 'ready', 'marker', 'fact', 'marker', 'make', 'think', 'play']"

Dated since 1st year. Proposed 3 months ago. She said that she told her parents about that and they agree with her choice.

Yesterday she went back to home country as spring semester ended for a week. When she sent a photo i noticed no ring on her hand. She confessed that she didnt told her parents as her dad would not agree with that as he morally thinks she is still his little daughter and wont accept that and will be mad.

Edit: 
She chose the chose the ring. Very expensive i would say.

Edit 2:
what is important is that she lied to me. I am just trying to understand what would be actual reason, could be she is meeting someone else? As she is offline half of the day, says spends time outdoors/shopping with family and does not wants to buy local sim to purchase data to go online to talk to me.

Edit 4:
We also had a fight days before her flight because of me being too jealous towards her, she sometimes gives short looks to guys over 30 years old in public places. Then she said she wants open relationship, when i said i will be happy with that,she replied that she said that because of being angry and does not wants that. 
I am not sure what is happening with her, but what i know is that during break up for a year she almost started dating 30 years old guy. She lied about it to me,i find out that through her email with her psychologist that she cant date 30 y guy because she does not want me to think bad of her.

(I apologize if this is poorly constructed!) 

So my boyfriend(21m) and I (21f) have just moved into a new area. He reconnected with an old high school friend about a month ago and he and his wife have been over to our house pretty much every day/night since they reconnected. Everyday the boys come home from work, they are ALWAYS at our house. Don’t get me wrong, I like them. They are very nice friends and the wife and I get along very well! But I never have any alone time to spend with my boyfriend anymore. The only alone time I get with him is when we go to bed (they stay until 10 or 11 pm). 

Here’s another issue I’m facing: my boyfriend is always “too tired” for sex. He says he’s still very attracted to me but at the end of the day he’s just too tired. So we never have sex anymore. My confidence level has plummeted and my anxiety is getting pretty bad too. I just got put on new anxiety medicine so I think that’s why I might be too emotional about this whole situation. 

Fast forward to last night. Those friends came over last night and we just hung out and they stayed the night. We all had something to drink so we didn’t want them driving home which I’m totally fine with. But then this morning my boyfriend wakes up and leaves with them to help them mow their lawn at their house. Normally I wouldn’t be bothered by that but he didn’t even ask if we were planning on doing anything today or even considered how I would feel about it. I feel like I haven’t truly spent any time with him anymore and he’s distancing himself from me. Maybe he’s just caught up in the moment of seeing his friend again.  Maybe it’s just me being too emotional.

72,8klj8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8klj8o/what_are_my_options/,What are my options?,"It's a long one. Tried to get the full picture in. Please help. 
I'd like to know:
What options do you have when you're relationship ended suddenly - Because of misunderstanding and because he ""didnt want us to develop stronger feelings for each other. Cause he doesn't want a relationship right now?"" ?? 
Do I have options? What are they? 

I know that comment. It's pretty black and white. He doesn't want a relationship. So therefore I should move on. BUT
Finding it hard to accept that he doesn't want a relationship and it has to be the end. During our time together, he reflected that he did want to be with me in a relationship and said he did the whole time. He consistently went out of his way to be with me and to make me happy. He put in a lot of effort and time in which showed he cared a lot of me. He told me how he felt about me. He wanted to be with me. He also introduced me to his life and his people. I met friends and family. He seeked their approval of me (and got it) which made him proud. And that's all not nothing. He continually put in a lot of effort
and showed he cared and that he wanted to be with me. And he isn't an arse who just wanted sex. 

It ended over a month ago. It was very sudden. Everything was fine, but basically I think it was an issue of space, he probably wanted some and I pushed for answers. We didn't manage it well. I definitely didn't. He ended up messaging me he didn't want to talk cause I kept pushing the point too far, when he wanted space (and when he was out with friends). And I said that I was sorry, and how I guess he wasn't that interested in me anymore... he did not reply. And that was apparently the end. I saw his last message at the time as a stab, a closed book, but now I realise he was explaining how he felt. No one at the time did anything. No one reached out or tried to fix it. I didn't know what to do. It seemed at the time like it was done. I didn't think I could do anything. I was hurt. And I realised how I liked him a lot. I was falling in love. But it had apparently ended. 

I sent a message weeks later. And then I got a message where he apologised if he hurt me and finally explained what happened - how it went too quick, he had wanted space because he didn't want stronger feelings to develop between us and he doesn't want a relationship at this stage in his life, but thinks very highly of me. And hoped I was ok and work was going well. At first I accepted it. It helped me that he said sorry. But now my mind keeps searching for explanation and options. I believe it didn't need to end that way. 

From my time with him I saw his desires. He wanted a relationship. He put a lot of effort in to build one. But he wants to be with his mates and play footy and doesn't want anything or anyone to get in the way of that. And I don't think he thinks he can have both. I also believe he got scared and that my actions pushed him over the edge. Maybe he isn't ready. It was going so fast, towards the end he pulled away a bit and now I see he wanted some space. I pushed for answers because I didn't understand. There seemed to be a realisation period of shit what is happening - this is serious and happening fast. I wasn't even keeping up with it. I didn't realise that I was falling in love with him, until after the fact. I never said how I felt. It's kinda like our feelings grew stronger, without us even realising and our communication skills didn't match up to how we felt. 

He could both calm me and excite me. I have never experienced something that has felt so right. I have never wanted to fix a past relationship before. Never. This whole thing is foreign territory. Do I have an option where I can try open dialogue between us?

I just wish I had options. Or knew what my options even were. Is the only thing I can do is try and accept his rapid change of heart, and just learn from it and heal from the loss to move on? Cause I still find it hard to believe that's what he actually really wants. Seems more like being scared/misunderstandings. And I know that may seem strange but his comments and what happened, just does not match any of it to what happened. 

Do I have any options?

Though things became a bit more flirty between us after and I thought things were going pretty well.

She told me she enjoys being single and is not ready to commit yet which I accepted but not knowing how to respond to that I said: ""whenever you're ready."" in which she thought I was actually asking her when she'd have an answer \(she's not a native english speaker\) and it might've been a poor choice of words... I meant to imply that things should be on her own accord. Anyways, I explained it to her and poured my heart out once more \(again probably not the best idea\) and told her about what I meant and all. She then however replied with just thanks and then I told her to please understand my position and I asked is everything okay between us in which she replied with yep I understand you.

So 10 months of relationship, I live in switzerland and he's swiss. I have been busting my ass for the past year and a half to learn german. I have put so much time and money into it, and everytime someone hears me talk they compliment me with ""oh you're fucking amazing at speaking the language"", to which i always say ""not good enough"", because I am a realistic person and I can't understand the news or the newspaper yet (that answer is modesty).

But lately I have been becoming more and more resentful towards my boyfriend because I have someone who speaks the language natively, and I tell myself there is NO better resource than that. When we met we spoke english and over time I tried to make the switch in the relationship to german, but it's been hard for him ""Because he's not used to it"". Nowadays we speak it like 60% of our day, but the easy stuff. I tell myself this is not enough because I don't get to learn the hard words, in the serious conversations. I already know the easy stuff. I need to up the bar!

So the problem: I told him ""learning german with you is not fulfilling my expectations, could we do something about it"", and he said I am complaining, I am ungrateful, and even if he teaches me one word a day it's more than he should. He doesn't get paid and his free time is used when he explains me things.

For me a relationship is based off mutual respect and SUPPORT, and clearly I am not getting that here. I was expecting an answer in the sense ""oh, okay, let's see what you're unhappy with and what can we do about it"" instead of that bullshit answer.

What do you guys think? I tell myself this relationship has drawn a lot of energy and time from me, I have helped him with spanish, programming, cooking, cleaning his apartment and stuff, and I would help him anyway I could. So I told him I don't want to settle down for the crumbs he's giving me and I feel this relationship is mediocre, so that he's a ""selfish motherfucker"".

Do you think saying this was over the line? Was I disrespectful? When we are upset I think we can cross the line but I stayed in the frame of truth, and I don't know how to get the message through.

Help!

tl;dr : my boyfriend speaks german because he's a native and doesn't teach me ""enough"". I have been disrespectful to him because I want to change this. What do I do? 

Edit: he always tells me ""i cant teach you all the things at once, it takes time"". Of course it takes time but this is too mediocre for me... :/

I don't mind drugs, I used to do them, but my rule is don't bring them to the apartment and don't get caught. the people he does this stuff with is already in trouble for drugs, my roommate has gotten a DUI and i feel like he is going down a spiral.

Please help","I’m 25[M] currently in a ‘taking it slow’ relationship with a heartbroken girl (22[F]) from a past relationship. We both started developing feelings for each other, but she recently came out of a long-distance relationship (about 3 months) with her ex. I needed to leave the country for about a month due to business, but when I was about to leave she told me that she was starting to get attached to me and that she was scared because she isn’t ready to like somebody yet, so she wanted to take it slow with me. I told her that it was ok and that she should take as much time and space as she wants and that the last thing I want is to pressure/drag her into something that she doesn’t feel comfortable with. I left the country and since then she calls me every day, but recently when we talked she told me that she just can’t imagine herself dating someone right now. 

I didn’t know how to react to this statement by her. I immediately thought to myself that maybe me being affectionate towards her through the phone made her feel claustrophobic/pressured into thinking that I needed an immediate answer from her regarding our relationship or that I was rushing into things. So, I told her that nothing’s changed and that she was honest about how slow she wanted to go from the start and that its just me. My actions pushed her away and that I was excited when she told me how she felt towards me, so I acted based on how I felt. I told her that she needed time and space and that she can be selfish about it. And she concisely replied, ‘Thanks for saying that’. She called me the other day, and she ended the call telling me that I didn’t understand how she felt most of the time. I feel like I’m missing something here. I just don’t know what… Please help me. It’s been like two days since we talked which is abnormal. Should I just continue to be patient? Thank you

79,8kl34j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kl34j/old_friend_23f_shows_up_at_my_18f_house_after/,Old friend (23F) shows up at my (18F) house after having a crush on me for 5 years and I don’t know how to let her down gently without risking her hurting herself,"So when I was 13 I met this girl who lives in my neighborhood through my twin sister and she seemed a little off but I don’t judge and we became friends. It was me, my sister, our best friend and the girl all hanging out and we were all 13ish and she was 18 at the time.

She always casually talked about hurting herself and about when she starved herself and would mention her suicide attempts which was a huge red flag at first but I didn’t want to judge her as a person because she had a few mental problems

It started when she first started having a crush on me which I was completely oblivious to because I was young and she would always talk about her boyfriend so I didn’t think she was flirting. But she started saying she liked girls which I’m fine with I’m bisexual myself but I didn’t know it at the time

But she kept getting weirder asking if I liked girls and I would just say “I don’t know” because I was confused at the time and she always kept saying “we’re gonna date when you turn 18” and I kept saying “idk there’s this guy I like” but I never said no which was a huge mistake on my part

Everything quieted down after she went off to a group home after another suicide attempt and I kinda just forgot about her for a while and moved on with my life

When she came back she kept messaging saying things like “you’re so beautiful” “I wish we could cuddle” etc. and I just blocked her trying to avoid confrontation and hoping she got the hint but nope. I blocked her on Facebook so she made an Instagram account and would still try to talk to me and when I blocked her she’d make a new account and I know I should’ve said something but I didn’t and it kept going on for a few years but slowed down eventually 

My senior year of high school, however, she returned to finish high school and I’d occasionally see her in the hallway and she’d always try to talk to me so I kept a light causal conversation but nothing too friendly. She kept making new Instagram accounts but after a while and after I graduated she stopped messaging

Then last week she shows up at my house. We live in the same neighborhood so it wasn’t too weird, but still weird. Our front door was open and just had the glass door so we couldn’t just ignore her so my sister answered the door and said I was busy and went on a walk with her and our dog. My sister said when she was walking she kept weirdly repeating the same phrases “what kind of dog is that” (and then my sister would answer) “I’m afraid of dogs, my brother got bit by my dog and now I’m afraid of dogs” “what kind of dog is that” and didn’t really say anything more which was kinda weird

And I’ve been legit stalked before (this guy sexually assaulted me and then stalked me) so having her show up at my house gave me more anxiety that it probably should. And today she showed up at my house again but my front door was closed so I just ignored her till she went away

I know a lot of this is my fault and I’ve made it a lot worse but I’m really feeling lost right now. I know how unstable she is and I’m afraid if I tell her to leave me alone she’ll hurt herself or try to kill her self and I don’t want that at all. I also don’t know if she would even understand if I told her to stop talking to me she really doesn’t seem like she’s in the right state of mind 

I’ve dug myself in a hole with this girl and I’m really lost on what I can do now

i thought they LOVED her up until this last conversation, and im happy with my girlfriend

they think she is trying to make me cut ties and ignore my parents so she has me to herself. 

my GF is lovely and i didnt really see too many red flags like this, and have always thought i would one day marry her.

only red flags ive noticed have been
:she doesnt seem to exactly love me going to parties with my friends.
: she wants to spend ALOT of time with me (all day)
:sometimes i miss being single (going to nightclubs, meeting people ect)
:when im out with my girlfriend, she seems to only want to hang out with me, and is kind of always a downer (moping around, upset, when im running around having a good time with my friends)

This isn't the first time we've been hands on on nights out, she will often touch my chest and hold me, and I will put my arm round her waist and whatever. There have been flat ""speculations"" we're sleeping together, but this isn't true. We've never gone passed the point of touching and flirting.

I've never tried to do anything with her (I know I've been a dick already for not rejecting this behaviour) because it feels wrong to, but also because I like the attention because I find her extremely attractive, if I'm being honest, and if I had the chance to I would date her.

Anyway, we're just about to have our summer holidays, over which time I'll probably only see her once if that before we live in a seperate flat next year.

I would like something to happen between us, but I also don't want it to be a drunken thing which results in a massive fallout. On the other hand, if she stopped being so flirtatious I would find it easier just to accept she has a boyfriend and not to try anything (I was told by her friend not to try anything earlier this year). 

Will us having time away from each other calm the situation? I really should have talked to her about this rather than waiting it out but it's too late now.

We are both 26 and ready to get married.I need someone to put me out of my misery and help me reach a decision.,"What should i do?I have been with my current boyfriend for 6 years now. We really love each other, but his parents don't like  me for no apparent reason(Other than the fact that i am South Indian, they are North Indian) . Boyfriend tried reasoning with his parents , but they are only worried about the society. Not to forget they are completely dependent of boyfriend financially but refuse to let him make his own decisions like a grown up. I really love him, but it bothers me that he can not stand up for what he thinks is right . His parents are condescending about their own sons achievement. He says he needs to get to a decision in within a months time. I decided the best thing for me is to list down my pros and cons so that i am able to reach a conclusion at the end of this month. Sadly cons are more (all thanks to his parents).For your reference pros and cons are listed below:

Pros:
- We love, understand and support each other
-We have similar views on our career front and ambitions
- We fight very little as both of us truly believe in the concept of adjustments
- Similar views on raising children and similar faiths
-Very ambitious and a family guy, respects my family and hold family as his utmost important

Coming to Cons
- He is not capable of standing up for himself , how can i expect him to take a stand for me?
- His parents are extremely nosy . They have to have a say in everything that he does . This means any decision that we take be it financial or personal they will interfere.
- They are not reasonable , i.e logic is not their strong suite ..( Boyfriends words not mine)
- Has a sibling who is working but still financially dependent on him, as are his parents.
- My family is open minded and very simple as opposed to his. This will definitely lead to lot of disputes
-They expect me to be a house wife where as i am currently running my business and am not ready to give up on it.

Despite all the cons i am unable to take a stand . I love him and i am ready to go all the way, stand with him till the end. I really need someone to give me their perspective as a third person.He (Boyfriend) is an overall nice guy with great upbringing, but lacks the conviction to take a stand for himself. 

Please help.

I'm going to post this to both depression and relationship advice to see either side. I've tried to keep it short and I'm not even sure if it paints the correct picture? I'm not usually an emotional guy, but being with a depressed girl has made me struggle.

I need help with a problem I'm going through. I (M25) met a girl (F19) at the start of the year with depression, we became best friends. I'm from England and she's from Sweden. She's got chronic depression, adhd, austism and some other issues that come with depression like commitment issues and anxiety. I think I have abandoment issues, but I've never been to see anyone about it. I get lows from time to time, but it's nothing like what you suffer though.

Our relationship developed as we got closer and we began to flirt and sext one another. This led me to visiting her in Sweden for a week on her birthday. She doesn't have any close friends a part from me, she has always struggled to have friends due to her mental health problems. She only has guy friends and has ended up being in relationships with some of them in the past. They've all ended poorly and never spoke again.

Anyway the week we were together in Sweden, I fell in love with her, but she was always switching from being really affectionate to being cold. We drank on her birthday, she told me she loved me, we were having sex a lot and we were really enjoying each others company. At other times when we were walking around, she'd suddenly decide she didn't want to hold my hand anymore and push away. It was like she was having a fight inside and she didn't know what she wanted. I tried to let her have time after I returned home, but she went cold and we weren't speaking anywhere near as much as we were. This was due to her depression, she got a few bits of bad news all together, we had a pregnancy scare and she went into a real bad depression.

I couldn't get her out of it, I was getting really drained by it. I wasn't thinking straight and I got clingy. I told her to give me a little bit of commitement or I have to leave. This was selfish of me, I see it now, but I didn't see it then. She accepted and things went really good for a week between us. Then it went really bad for two weeks, she was cold again and distant. She had other things on her mind, but I wasn't thinking right. I got clingy again wanting to be boyfriend/girlfriend, but she couldn't and that she'd lost interest, yet still wanted me in her life. I said I needed time to think. The next day I travelled for a wedding abroad for a week and god that sucked. Don't go on holiday after a break up, it's pretty shit.

I had a lot of time to think, it felt to me that she got too close to me, got scared, her depression made her confused and made her pull away. Her pulling away scared me and I got clingy because I wasn't thinking straight. Typing this out is making me really sound like a douche, I'm struggling to type what we actually went through as I'd end up typing a 10,000 word post.

We argued yesterday and I'm pretty sure I managed to kill any chance of us getting back together by being an idiot. She's really depressed and suicidal at the moment, I've just made things worse by leaving her on her own. I'm the one person she opens up to. I want to be friends with her, but it really hurts and I need time away.

Should I take the pain and be there for her when she needs someone? Or should I look after myself, I don't see us getting back together and I really need time to heal.

I think I need time and hopefully when I get over her, we can stay friends, but I'm going to feel like a douche leaving her on her own. Before me she bounced around with guys, I feel she might do that again.

Be as harsh to me as you want, I've hurt the woman I love.

Ask questions please, I know it's not written the best, I'll try to answer them better.

TLDR: Made friends with a depressed girl, started dating, wanted commitment when she was under depression, broke up, fought, but still could be friends, left her on her own while he's depressed and suicidal.","['m25', 'need', 'help', 'break', 'ex', 'f19', 'lonely', 'suicidal', 'hello', 'friend', 'go', 'post', 'depression', 'relationship', 'advice', 'try', 'short', 'sure', 'paint', 'correct', 'picture', 'usually', 'emotional', 'guy', 'depressed', 'girl', 'struggle', 'need', 'help', 'problem', 'go', 'm25', 'meet', 'girl', 'f19', 'start', 'year', 'depression', 'good', 'friend', 'england', 'sweden', 'get', 'chronic', 'depression', 'adhd', 'austism', 'issue', 'come', 'depression', 'like', 'commitment', 'issue', 'anxiety', 'think', 'abandoment', 'issue', 'low', 'time', 'time', 'like', 'suffer', 'relationship', 'develop', 'get', 'close', 'begin', 'flirt', 'sext', 'lead', 'visit', 'sweden', 'week', 'birthday', 'close', 'friend', 'struggle', 'friend', 'mental', 'health', 'problem', 'guy', 'friend', 'end', 'relationship', 'past', 'end', 'poorly', 'speak', 'week', 'sweden', 'fall', 'love', 'switch', 'affectionate', 'cold', 'drink', 'birthday', 'tell', 'love', 'have', 'sex', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'company', 'time', 'walk', 'suddenly', 'decide', 'want', 'hold', 'hand', 'anymore', 'push', 'away', 'like', 'have', 'fight', 'inside', 'know', 'want', 'try', 'let', 'time', 'return', 'home', 'go', 'cold', 'speak', 'near', 'depression', 'get', 'bit', 'bad', 'news', 'pregnancy', 'scare', 'go', 'real', 'bad', 'depression', 'get', 'drain', 'think', 'straight', 'get', 'clingy', 'tell', 'little', 'bit', 'commitement', 'leave', 'selfish', 'accept', 'thing', 'go', 'good', 'week', 'go', 'bad', 'week', 'cold', 'distant', 'thing', 'mind', 'think', 'right', 'get', 'clingy', 'want', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'lose', 'interest', 'want', 'life', 'say', 'need', 'time', 'think', 'day', 'travel', 'wedding', 'abroad', 'week', 'god', 'suck', 'holiday', 'break', 'pretty', 'shit', 'lot', 'time', 'think', 'feel', 'get', 'close', 'get', 'scared', 'depression', 'confused', 'pull', 'away', 'pull', 'away', 'scare', 'get', 'clingy', 'think', 'straight', 'type', 'make', 'sound', 'like', 'douche', 'struggle', 'type', 'actually', 'go', 'end', 'type', '10,000', 'word', 'post', 'argue', 'yesterday', 'pretty', 'sure', 'manage', 'kill', 'chance', 'get', 'idiot', 'depressed', 'suicidal', 'moment', 'thing', 'bad', 'leave', 'person', 'open', 'want', 'friend', 'hurt', 'need', 'time', 'away', 'pain', 'need', 'look', 'get', 'need', 'time', 'heal', 'think', 'need', 'time', 'hopefully', 'stay', 'friend', 'go', 'feel', 'like', 'douche', 'leave', 'bounce', 'guy', 'feel', 'harsh', 'want', 'hurt', 'woman', 'love', 'ask', 'question', 'know', 'write', 'good', 'try', 'answer', 'well', 'tldr', 'friend', 'depressed', 'girl', 'start', 'date', 'want', 'commitment', 'depression', 'break', 'fight', 'friend', 'leave', 'depressed', 'suicidal']"
86,8kkaif,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kkaif/shes_depressed_and_wants_to_end_our_relationship/,She's depressed and wants to end our relationship,"My girlfriend sent me a text message that broke my heart a few days ago, she said that she felt it's better if we part ways because she can't feel the love she has for me just few days earlier before sending me the text, she said she felt like she keep losing feelings for me and she is sorry and doesn't want to waste my time.

Before she sent me that, I had talked to her because I noticed something was off and she told me that her mom has found out we are dating and she is disappointed at my girlfriend, her mom was crying because of it reminded her of bad memories she had when she was at my girlfriend's age, my girlfriend felt extremely bad about it and she kept blaming herself for what happened that day. She also got a text from her ex\-boyfriend asking how she is and if I was good to her, which she replied ""yes"".

There are a lot of other things happening in her life right now, she is blaming herself for breaking her ex's heart, she doesn't have time for herself because she has after school lessons and when she got home she has to study and do her assignments, and she would use whatever free time she has to call me and talk to me, which made me feel guilty for taking away her ""alone time"", but I didn't tell her that because it would just make things worse for her.

But back to the situation, she said that she wants a break, I told her that I'll be there to support her and if she wants a break, I'll give her a break, because I understands what she's going through and I've been there before, I asked her how long of a break she thinks she would need but she didn't reply, I waited a while assuming she was probably doing something else first but then I got worried and I asked if she was ok, she replied back after a few hours and I was already asleep at that time. I woke up, checked her text, and I started to overthink again, what if she is just saying she is depressed as an excuse to get away from me, what if she found someone else? Am I too stale for her? 

So yeah, that got me worried so I wanted to make sure she knows that I support her and I'm willing to listen to her if she ever needs someone to talk to, so I waited until she is online to text her, but she never went online on Discord \(That's what we use to chat mostly\), so I went to Messenger and I saw her online, so I sent her a message saying that I'll be there if she needs someone to talk to and if she ever feel down she can talk to me, but she never responded, I see her online, but she never replied or saw the message.

I did remember telling her that she should probably take this weekend off \(She helps out running her parent's restaurant during the weekends\), and getaway from people in general to cool off and give sometime for herself, so she might be doing just that and that's why she's not replying to me.

So with that being said, what can I do to help her out? I don't want her to leave me forever, I wish this relationship could be reestablished one day. But I understand that when we go on breaks like this it's better to think of it as over and see someone else, but I'm not gonna do that, because I promised her I will be there and I honestly dislike most of the girls in my school.

What is this called?,"Throw-away account because my gf uses reddit, but I need some advice here. I caught my gf in several pretty big lies this week and confronted her on Wed. She tried to turn it around on me by saying she can't believe I'd ruin her week by blaming her something that didn't even happen and told me I'm trying to make her miserable because I am.

I kept my foot down and explained no, I'm mad because you've been lying to me. She ignored that and said something else completely off the wall that made no sense and I said look... i'm mad you keep lying, that is it. Stop lying. That's when she finally acknowledged that she has been lying to me...  I said I can't trust you I don't want to talk to you for awhile. She called me today apologizing and in our talk picked apart some comment I made and completely blew it out of proportion to turn this all around on me and now she's threatening to leave me telling me not to talk to her. Which is what I asked of her only two days ago.... she crawled back then flipped it and reversed it!

It's ridiculous I know, but what is this called. Is this a form of gaslighting? Is there anything I can do or do I just need to give up hope with her and move on? I'd like to make things work but she's become so combative and creates battles with me quite often when I approach a subject she doesn't want to talk to me about.

I have a tendency to start saying something and stop, so that she get's suspicious and is like 'what?' and I'm just like 'I want to say things but I don't know if I should say things.'

I'm going out of town for a month and she drove me home last night. I played some sad songs in the car and I made her get out of the car and hug me cuz I won't see her for a month. She hugged me for longer than usual \(which is really weird for her\) 

Later, she sent a snapchat to our groupchat of us and our mutual friend saying ""I'm experiencing your wanting to say something but not knowing if I should thing.""

I told her it's usually better to say it cuz it makes life easier. I wasn't really sure then if she wanted to say something to me or to someone else or if she was gonna say it to the group chat.

But then she texted just me, which we rarely do, we usually just use the group chat. She said she was really gonna miss me, and that I'm really important to her. We talked for about an hour and she repeated at least 5 times that it annoys her that she can't say what she wants to. 

I was super hyped by this convo cuz for us it's pretty rare to text one on one \(though we talk a lot in person\) and she said like a lot of emotional stuff about being very close to me and being comfortable and missing me. 

I'm just still really unsure cuz I told her that I liked her like year ago and we basically flirt with each other all the time and hint at that sort of thing but I'm just...I don't know if I should read into it?? Like it kind of renewed my hopes that she might like me, but...what do you think?

3month ago he got sick with his kidneys and the sex stopped, he was sick so was never expecting intimacy but it never came back.. previous to this everything was amazing..

I asked him was it me, he said not. Just that his libido had gone.. 

Previous to being with me he had been large in size and had lost the weight, we have both put just over a stone in weight on, which we are both  losing, we have fitness trackers, bikes etc.. 

He lost his job and then was out of work for a week but wages between old and new job left him out of money for a month but that didn’t matter in that I could support which I did, he didn’t like that part.. 
New job is long hours and physical but he loves it, just a lot of stress comes with it. 
He gets home on a night and is falling asleep after 2 hours, I’ve never complained about this as I can see he is so tired. 
We slept in separate rooms as he hated waking me in the early morning, but we always had a cuddle before bed time,
The kisses were there, the hugs were there, the loving texts and messages every day were there. 

He has two boys who I adore and they do me. 
They come to stay and are doing as usual. 

He came home last Wednesday and said he can’t go on in this.. he hates himself at the moment, doesn’t understand why he hasn’t got the feelings he thinks he should have for me, he loves me and said he knows he has everything he could possibly want but doesn’t have the feelings. 

We go on holiday for 2weeks in 21 days time. We still plan to go. 

We still live together and will do until next Feb. 
He wants to keep the bills etc the same for the house.. 

I’m in total shock.. other than the lack of sex issue everything was great. Plans being made for future etc.. 

I’m at a complete loss, and don’t know where to turn... 
I don’t want to give up on something so good..

He asked me to sleep with him but I refused. And he turned cold. I finally asked him if he only sees me as a fling. He said he sees me as a friend all along. Recently I discovered that he was indeed two-timing me during a period when we were together.

I don't know how should I treat this jerk who made use of me and played with my feelings. Should I totally ignore him? Treat him cold like how he treated me?

We’ll have dinner, go for drinks sometimes, and do “familyish” stuff. However, I’ve noticed a couple of times now that my boyfriends family does not respect him.

I don’t get involved and nor do I really want to. I would like to at least say something to my boyfriend but am afraid to. 

The real problem I’m having now though is, i myself now don’t feel like I respect him how I use to. I see myself looking down on him or kind of feeling that I am better than him. It’s like my whole outlook on him changed when I saw his family disrespect him and he didn’t stand up for himself.

Quick backstory, my wife(32F) and I(33M) recently hit a rough patch, and actually had our first marriage counseling session today.  We both have issues to work on, but the counsellor said we need to do some self reflection.  

So i have come up with a few of my faults that i want look at, and thought there may be some useful advice out there.

1. Trust.  I have trust issues, both my parents left me as a child and i had an ex fiance whom left me for a good friend of mine.  Im worried and certain this has spilled into my life with not only my wife but other areas too.  How do i learn to trust again?

2. Control.  I like things done in a certain manner.  In the last few years, i find my self giving people orders rather than asking.  Or just as bad, telling them how to do almost anything in detail, because thats how i need it done.  How do i let go of control and let in this case my wife, do things as she sees fit?

3.  Letting Go.  Lastly, when things do not go my way, i have a tendency to dwell.   I can stay angry or upset for days.  I hold onto stress, and im not only worried about my marriage but my health as well.  How do i learn to let things go?

My wife and I have had a wonderful marriage for over 10years.  I know we can work past it, but i need to work on myself as well.

TL;DR.  Help me to trust, not control and let things go.","['need', 'help', 'marriage', 'hello', 'quick', 'backstory', 'wife', '32_f', '33_m', 'recently', 'hit', 'rough', 'patch', 'actually', 'marriage', 'counseling', 'session', 'today', 'issue', 'work', 'counsellor', 'say', 'need', 'self', 'reflection', 'come', 'fault', 'want', 'look', 'think', 'useful', 'advice', '1', 'trust', 'trust', 'issue', 'parent', 'leave', 'child', 'ex', 'fiance', 'leave', 'good', 'friend', 'be', 'worried', 'certain', 'spill', 'life', 'wife', 'area', 'learn', 'trust', '2', 'control', 'like', 'thing', 'certain', 'manner', 'year', 'find', 'self', 'give', 'people', 'order', 'ask', 'bad', 'tell', 'detail', 's', 'need', 'let', 'control', 'let', 'case', 'wife', 'thing', 'see', 'fit', '3', 'letting', 'lastly', 'thing', 'way', 'tendency', 'dwell', 'stay', 'angry', 'upset', 'day', 'hold', 'stress', 'be', 'worried', 'marriage', 'health', 'learn', 'let', 'thing', 'wife', 'wonderful', 'marriage', '10year', 'know', 'work', 'past', 'need', 'work', 'tl;dr', 'help', 'trust', 'control', 'let', 'thing']"
102,8kinqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kinqh/my_21f_boyfriend_21m_of_2_years_has_never/,My [21F] boyfriend [21M] of 2 years has never worked/volunteered a day in his life,"As a disclaimer, this is a throwaway account. I'm going to start with some background information, but please feel free to skip down to where I've asterisked! For the sake of this post, I'm going to name my boyfriend Adam.

My boyfriend and I first met in seventh grade. I had strong feelings for Adam, but he was in a relationship which lasted for about two years \(until freshman year of high school\). We progressively grew more and more distant until he confronted me in ninth grade to tell me that he liked me during middle school. The two of us became close again after his breakup, but we both eventually entered two long\-term relationships. \(Later, I found out that Adam was going to ask me out but was persuaded by a friend, who also liked me, not to do so.\) He mutually broke up with his girlfriend during junior/senior year of high school, and I continued dating my boyfriend throughout my first semester of college. Over winter break of freshman year, we met with two friends at a local eatery, and I realized how unhappy I was in my current relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend shortly after in late January and started talking to Adam while he was 5\+ hours away at college. He came home during spring break, and we hung out several times; he asked me to be his girlfriend when he came home after finishing his freshman year of college.

\* In the fall of 2016, Adam started his sophomore year of college but was struggling in his computer science classes. His mental health was getting progressively worse, and after coming home for Thanksgiving break, he simply couldn't deal with the course load anymore. \(I think it had something to do with the fact that he was 5\+ hours away from home and that he was missing me and his family.\) A week or so before finals, Adam admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital where he stayed for a few days. He was not able to complete his finals nor receive final grades for the semester. During winter break, he decided to take a semester off from college while he was attending weekly group therapy sessions as well as individual psychotherapy sessions. Adam and I were thankful that he decided to stay home because not only did our relationship thrive and blossom but also his mental health greatly improved.

After taking a semester off from school in the spring of 2017, I was a little surprised when Adam didn't want to work or volunteer over the summer. \(I'm an extremely conscientious student and have been working a part\-time job since my sophomore year of college. I've also completed an internship and will be working two jobs while interning this upcoming summer.\) However, I actively reminded myself that the academic trauma in the fall was still fresh and that he should focus on preparing for the fall semester at a local public college.

Now, let's fast\-forward to present day.

It has been about 1 and 1/2 years since Adam dropped out of his computer science program to transfer to a school closer to home, and he is about to start his junior year of college. For the most part, I would say that my boyfriend has been happy. He has continued his weekly group therapy sessions and has reported liking it, although he recently stopped individually seeing his psychotherapist \(which is not a decision I agree with.\) As far as school goes, I know for a fact that he does not regret choosing to come back home to complete his degree. However, Adam has not applied for any part\-time jobs, picked up any volunteer positions, or committed to any extracurricular activities at school, and I'm starting to worry because his resume is essentially blank. 

Although my boyfriend has no desire to partake in any activities at school or in the community, I understand that these two things are more personality\-based and that these won't make or break his future. Sure, I would like to see him be a little bit more involved, but volunteering and having an extracurricular activity won't directly contribute to his financial/professional success. With that being said, my biggest concern is that my boyfriend doesn't seem to be motivated to get a job, despite voicing his concerns about spending his dad's money. \(His dad makes $100k\+ a year as a CEO of a computer software company to solely support his family of four.\) I don't even think my boyfriend has applied for a job anywhere.

At this rate, I'm nervous about having a financially stable future with my boyfriend. \(Currently, I'm moving out of my parent's house into an apartment, and I've said to myself that I won't let him move in until he gets a job.\) I'm nervous about my boyfriend's chances of getting a job and getting into graduate school \(because he has said that he wants to get his master's\). I'm nervous about Adam's level of motivation and how that's going to play in marriage.

I've tried talking to my boyfriend about applying for a part\-time job at GameStop or other local video game stores, but he doesn't seem interested, even though he is a huge video game fanatic. \(Our mutual best friend has also tried talking to him with no luck.\) I haven't voiced my concerns about his professional future because I'm not sure how to go about it in a non\-threatening way, so any advice in that area would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My boyfriend has never worked, volunteered, or been involved at school. He doesn't seem to be motivated to do any of those three things, and I'm nervous about the fate of our relationship. I'm looking for advice on how to talk to him about it and how to handle the situation moving forward.","['21_f', 'boyfriend', '21_m', '2', 'year', 'work', 'volunteer', 'day', 'life', 'disclaimer', 'throwaway', 'account', 'go', 'start', 'background', 'information', 'feel', 'free', 'skip', 'asterisk', 'sake', 'post', 'go', 'boyfriend', 'adam', 'boyfriend', 'meet', 'seventh', 'grade', 'strong', 'feeling', 'adam', 'relationship', 'last', 'year', 'freshman', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'progressively', 'grow', 'distant', 'confront', 'ninth', 'grade', 'tell', 'like', 'middle', 'school', 'close', 'breakup', 'eventually', 'enter', 'long', '-term', 'relationship', 'later', 'find', 'adam', 'go', 'ask', 'persuade', 'friend', 'like', 'mutually', 'break', 'girlfriend', 'junior', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'continue', 'date', 'boyfriend', 'semester', 'college', 'winter', 'break', 'freshman', 'year', 'meet', 'friend', 'local', 'eatery', 'realize', 'unhappy', 'current', 'relationship', 'break', 'boyfriend', 'shortly', 'late', 'january', 'start', 'talk', 'adam', '5', 'hour', 'away', 'college', 'come', 'home', 'spring', 'break', 'hang', 'time', 'ask', 'girlfriend', 'come', 'home', 'finish', 'freshman', 'year', 'college', 'fall', '2016', 'adam', 'start', 'sophomore', 'year', 'college', 'struggle', 'computer', 'science', 'class', 'mental', 'health', 'get', 'progressively', 'bad', 'come', 'home', 'thanksgive', 'break', 'simply', 'deal', 'course', 'load', 'anymore', 'think', 'fact', '5', 'hour', 'away', 'home', 'miss', 'family', 'week', 'final', 'adam', 'admit', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'stay', 'day', 'able', 'complete', 'final', 'receive', 'final', 'grade', 'semester', 'winter', 'break', 'decide', 'semester', 'college', 'attend', 'weekly', 'group', 'therapy', 'session', 'individual', 'psychotherapy', 'session', 'adam', 'thankful', 'decide', 'stay', 'home', 'relationship', 'thrive', 'blossom', 'mental', 'health', 'greatly', 'improve', 'take', 'semester', 'school', 'spring', '2017', 'little', 'surprised', 'adam', 'want', 'work', 'volunteer', 'summer', 'extremely', 'conscientious', 'student', 'work', '-time', 'job', 'sophomore', 'year', 'college', 'complete', 'internship', 'work', 'job', 'intern', 'upcoming', 'summer', 'actively', 'remind', 'academic', 'trauma', 'fall', 'fresh', 'focus', 'prepare', 'fall', 'semester', 'local', 'public', 'college', 'let', 'fast', '-forward', 'present', 'day', '1', '1/2', 'year', 'adam', 'drop', 'computer', 'science', 'program', 'transfer', 'school', 'close', 'home', 'start', 'junior', 'year', 'college', 'boyfriend', 'happy', 'continue', 'weekly', 'group', 'therapy', 'session', 'report', 'like', 'recently', 'stop', 'individually', 'see', 'psychotherapist', 'decision', 'agree', 'far', 'school', 'go', 'know', 'fact', 'regret', 'choose', 'come', 'home', 'complete', 'degree', 'adam', 'apply', '-time', 'job', 'pick', 'volunteer', 'position', 'commit', 'extracurricular', 'activity', 'school', 'start', 'worry', 'resume', 'essentially', 'blank', 'boyfriend', 'desire', 'partake', 'activity', 'school', 'community', 'understand', 'thing', 'personality', '-base', 'break', 'future', 'sure', 'like', 'little', 'bit', 'involved', 'volunteer', 'have', 'extracurricular', 'activity', 'directly', 'contribute', 'financial', 'professional', 'success', 'say', 'big', 'concern', 'boyfriend', 'motivate', 'job', 'despite', 'voice', 'concern', 'spend', 'dad', 'money', 'dad', 'make', '$', '100k', 'year', 'ceo', 'computer', 'software', 'company', 'solely', 'support', 'family', 'think', 'boyfriend', 'apply', 'job', 'rate', 'nervous', 'have', 'financially', 'stable', 'future', 'boyfriend', 'currently', 'move', 'parent', 'house', 'apartment', 'say', 'let', 'get', 'job', 'nervous', 'boyfriend', 'chance', 'get', 'job', 'get', 'graduate', 'school', 'say', 'want', 'master', 'nervous', 'adams', 'level', 'motivation', 'go', 'play', 'marriage', 'try', 'talk', 'boyfriend', 'apply', '-time', 'job', 'gamestop', 'local', 'video', 'game', 'store', 'interested', 'huge', 'video', 'game', 'fanatic', 'mutual', 'good', 'friend', 'try', 'talk', 'luck', 'voice', 'concern', 'professional', 'future', 'sure', 'non', '-threatening', 'way', 'advice', 'area', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'tl;dr', 'boyfriend', 'work', 'volunteer', 'involve', 'school', 'motivate', 'thing', 'nervous', 'fate', 'relationship', 'look', 'advice', 'talk', 'handle', 'situation', 'move', 'forward']"

I’ve been really struggling because we don’t fight as much as frequently disagree or get annoyed with each other. I’ve been feeling very trapped cause I married my best friend (weird emotional back history in profile if you want it) 

We’ve tried over and over to fix things but I don’t love him. I SHOULD he is a wonderful person but I don’t. 

During the day I feel like I’ve accepted it but evenings are hard. It’s like watching a person that’s been dying a long time finally flatline and you want them to come back. But even if they do...it will still end. 

I’m terrified of the future and he is still a good friend but I’m so concerned I’m just being stupid with separating and it’s clearly me with the problem and if I can change or fix myself enough it will be ok. Cause I mean... it’s fine. It’s not good but it’s fine.

I immediately confronted her about it and we did get loud but never thought this have we got violent. I know when she lies just by her expressions as we been together for long enough now and could tell the entire time she was hiding something.

She told me she his it from me so long because she knew she had made a mistake and was afraid she was really gonna lose me for what she had done. I told her that I loved her and forgive her, I knew it was a mistake and understood as I cheated early in our relationship though mine was with the same sec and purely for sexual purpose and he's she says was emotions and not knowing who she wanted.

 Her excuse was he made her feel loved again and he would listen to all her problems were at the time me and her were still having communication issues. As soon as she give in to him he started treated her differently. I honestly feel bad for how she was treated, nobody ever wants to see what's supposed to be the lover of there life with another man but at the same time it pissed me off to see somebody break her heart. I really do understand and do love and forgive her, for the most part I blame myself for pushing her away but I can't stop visualizing what all happened that night and it's beginning to hurt me bad. I can't fall asleep on time or wake up either. I'm having trouble eating and performing sexually and I just don't want to feel this way. How do I get through this without pushing her out my life again with the depression? Somebody please help me save my relationship.

There is a girl that know from having a class with her last school year, and back in November I decided I wanted to be friends with her again. Barring extra details that I could explain if asked, after a very awkward conversation due to the fact that (I presume) she thought I was looking for a bf/gf relationship, we decided on ""simply being friends"". It was alright for a while, but due to me now not having a class with her, I would only really be saying Hi in the hallway or the rare 5-minute chat. 

Then at one point my grades took a steep drop and I abandoned almost all social activity and focused on fixing them. She eventually asked what was going on and I explained exactly that. After I had my grades at a manageable level, I began talking to her again. When that happened also lined up with when our school did our annual Musical. I was a cast and she was a stagehand, and being near each other let us talk a lot more than we usually do. I inevitably unloaded a lot of personal stuff onto her, which I really regret doing, and at one point she explained that she liked a friend of mine. She asked if ""[He] would still be [her] friend after the musical ended?"", and I, incorrectly, predicted Yes. 

After the musical did end, our connection was really weak, and come 2 weeks after we didn't talk at all. All of the evidence I have regarding that could have caused this is very conflicting and I cant find one single solution. I feel extremely compelled to apologize to her, but I'm not sure if it's the best idea to begin with, as this depends on whats actually going on. 

**Case 1 - She simply forgot about me.** As opposed to the first time, she hasn't asked me about whats going on. She could just be occupied with grades of her own or simply involved in her own life. If this is the case I don't want to apologize, as it would come out of nowhere and just result in me butting into her life which I don't want to do. 

**Case 2 - **After having to lose being friends with the friend of mine, and due to me practically treating her like a therapist (that's probably me over-exaggerating), **she doesn't want to have anything to do with me**. Over time I have noticed telltale signs that she might have never wanted to be friends with me in the first place, she being friends with me maybe out of pity, or maybe something else. I would want to apologize, but I don't want to seem like I'm apologizing for attention or anything like that. 

**Case 3 - Shes in my situation.** She has no clue what is going on, and might think *herself* that *I* don't want to be friends with *her*. I find this odd due to how I made the proposition in the first place, but considering how much ""logical hopscotch"" my mind likes to play when thinking about my social relationships, I feel like this still is a possibility. In this case if I did apologize, it may be awkward, but I don't believe it would harm anything, and I would want to do so. 

I am really troubled about all of this and its shown in the last few days. I've been asked if I was alright a lot recently so obviously something is showing. After thinking about it this long and being unable to draw any conclusion myself, I turn to ask people who *aren't* **totally socially inept for advice**. If you want to ask about something else I don't at all mind. Ill talk about any extra information.

I was her first, to penetrate her. I have had sex a few times with different people before. So in our relationship I have never been able to make her have an orgasm through penetration sex. I have eaten her out and made her cum 3 maybe 4 time, I'm leaning towards 3, times in our entire relationship so far. I did have a very hard time and negative feeling about not being able to make her orgasm more. I tried to learn as much as I could about why she couldn't and why I couldn't make her. I eventually came to terms with it and learned not every girl can from penetration and etc. I did learn she masturbates with a pillow I didn't think anything of it. I also learned that she can masturbate and make her self orgasm many times in a day doing it. One time she told me she did it 7 or 5 times in one day and she continues to masturbate now after entering in the relationship. So I wanted to see how she does it and for a long time she would never do it around me or in front of me. I got her to do it 3 times now around me. But she doesn't want to do it around me while I'm looking. So we have had some trouble with deciding when to have sex so we came to an agreement that no sex before 10am (for her) and no sex after 11 or 10pm (for me). I like morning sex she likes it at night so we compromised. So as a guy I'm attracted to her so sometimes I try to get her to be in the mood in the morning and she doesn't have any of that it's a no mostly all the time. She says she is just waking up and is not in the mood. Ok so why today did I catch her masturbating on the security camera at 730am and again at 10. I was at work by the way. So she can wake up masturbate twice before our agreement time but when I want to have sex she shuts me down. I try so hard to learn and do what she likes during sex. I'm not perfect I'm human. I use to be able to last an hour I still can but I kind of given up some because I don't get the reward of her orgasming from me penetrating her or doing oral. I even say you can masturbate with the pillow if she wants and she declines. I even go as far as say I'll leave the room so you can masturbate until you cum and I'll come back in after. She declines. She doesn't like to cum around me but at home she can masturbate and have multiple orgasms a night by her self. I even felt like for awhile when she would stay over that she masturbates behind my back as I'd sleep. We have talked about it many times before and I have moved past and assume she's not even though I think she might. She says she doesn't though. So after I found out she masturbated twice while I was at work and I come home. I ask her if she did. She said why do you want to know, she did say yeah she did I asked how many times and she didn't want to answer that. She later wanted to have sex but I wasn't feeling it. She orgasmed twice already so I'm going to do all this work and yet again as usual I get no reward. I just don't get why she can't orgasm around me or even desire an orgasm after haveing sex with me. If she sucks my dick you damn well better know I want you to suck it until I cum. Her, she doesn't want that. I eat her out and she just says she has had enough, same thing with sex.

117,8khvmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8khvmw/my_23yr_gf_was_fingered_by_her_23yr_male_friend/,My 23yr gf was fingered by her 23yr male friend,"My girlfriend told me about the incident a day or so after it happened. We are currently in a long distance relationship of two years (she lives in Frankfurt and I live in NYC). She was coming to the states in a couple of months to stay with me at my apartment for three months. Anyways, according to her, she has two close male friends that she knows from childhood who now work at the same restaurant as her. For about a month or so, occassionally she has been allowing her two friends to come over to her place and play video games and smoke hookah. They would usually arrive at her home shortly after 10p.m. at night and stay up late to where they all three would be tired so she has allowed them both to spend the night in a separate bed from hers. I did not hear about them staying at her place until just recently. This past weekend, only one of these male friends, who currently has a girlfirend, spent the night with her playing video games, smoking weed, and falling asleep in the same bed. She claims she woke up to him fingering her down there. To which, she claims she told him to stop and so he did. Apparently they both went back to sleep in the same bed. I asked her, why she did not kick him out of her apartment or off her bed when he crossed the line. She said she didn't know why she didn't kick him out but she did not allow him to have sex with her. I asked her why he didn't sleep on the floor or on the other bed and she told me he was supposed to but did not. I was very angry and upset so I broke up with her via video chat. Three factors led to me to that decision: (1) she should not have a man stay in her twin size bed with her while she is in a relationship with me (2) she shouldn't be smoking weed with him (that leads to emotional infidelity) and (3) I can not protect her from herself and her own decisions that increase her risk of injury to her life. In my view, it seems we have different values given that I regard my bed as sacred since it is where I spend my most vulnerable time and do not share it with any woman or man except my exclusive partner. Even though she was honest (I hope) in telling me what happened, there are still consequences to her actions. I love her very much, but I also love and respect myself. If she disrespected me by bringing a guy in her bed I can't continue on with the relationship. At the same time I feel she was exploited by this guy since he fingered her without her consent. Do you think I was extreme in breaking off my relationship with her?","['23yr', 'gf', 'finger', '23yr', 'male', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'tell', 'incident', 'day', 'happen', 'currently', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship', 'year', 'live', 'frankfurt', 'live', 'nyc', 'come', 'state', 'couple', 'month', 'stay', 'apartment', 'month', 'anyways', 'accord', 'close', 'male', 'friend', 'know', 'childhood', 'work', 'restaurant', 'month', 'occassionally', 'allow', 'friend', 'come', 'place', 'play', 'video', 'game', 'smoke', 'hookah', 'usually', 'arrive', 'home', 'shortly', '10_p.m', 'night', 'stay', 'late', 'tired', 'allow', 'spend', 'night', 'separate', 'bed', 'hear', 'stay', 'place', 'recently', 'past', 'weekend', 'male', 'friend', 'currently', 'girlfirend', 'spend', 'night', 'play', 'video', 'game', 'smoke', 'weed', 'fall', 'asleep', 'bed', 'claim', 'wake', 'finger', 'claim', 'tell', 'stop', 'apparently', 'go', 'sleep', 'bed', 'ask', 'kick', 'apartment', 'bed', 'cross', 'line', 'say', 'know', 'kick', 'allow', 'sex', 'ask', 'sleep', 'floor', 'bed', 'tell', 'suppose', 'angry', 'upset', 'break', 'video', 'chat', 'factor', 'lead', 'decision', '1', 'man', 'stay', 'twin', 'size', 'bed', 'relationship', '2', 'smoke', 'weed', 'lead', 'emotional', 'infidelity', '3', 'protect', 'decision', 'increase', 'risk', 'injury', 'life', 'view', 'different', 'value', 'give', 'regard', 'bed', 'sacred', 'spend', 'vulnerable', 'time', 'share', 'woman', 'man', 'exclusive', 'partner', 'honest', 'hope', 'tell', 'happen', 'consequence', 'action', 'love', 'love', 'respect', 'disrespect', 'bring', 'guy', 'bed', 'continue', 'relationship', 'time', 'feel', 'exploit', 'guy', 'finger', 'consent', 'think', 'extreme', 'break', 'relationship']"

Am I wrong for how I feel?,"Last night I was hanging out with my GF and a mutual friend. I had work in the morning at 4 am so I wasn't planning on staying out past ten. Our friend prompted us with the idea of going to the bar and I immediately declined but told my gf that she could go if she wanted. I wanted her to have fun because she has been a little in the dumps, I knew she needed to let loose little. I told her she couldn't dance with guys and told her I know I sound insecure. I said girls were fine. Well she came home at 2 am and we had a nice time together. Flash forward to lunch time for me. I check Snapchat and see that she messaged one of our group chats. She talked about how she was sad that she couldn't attract a girl, and that she tried dancing with one but they said that they had a girlfriend. Later on in the night the same girl my gf had talked to had started ""teasing"" her and they danced. I was fine with her dancing but she seemed a little to eager to get sexual with the girl in the words she told me in person. She repeatedly called the girl hot and said she was really into her. She also tweeted that she was needed to know the girls name. I told her to take the tweets down and that it hurt my feelings. We text back and forth and decided if we were going to argue about what happened it needed to be in person. Fast forward an hour ago. I told her that sleeping with anybody regardless of gender was cheating. I have a serious problem with cheating and we have had this type of discussion multiple times. I also let her know that if she wanted to experiment then we can't say we are in a committed relationship. I told her that I would wait for her until she was ready to be in a relationship with just me. She didn't take it very well and we shared tears and frustration. It hurts my feelings that she has doubt about wanting to be with JUST me and not any other person regardless of gender. We have actually gotten in an argument about the same thing before when she had made out with a friend when they were very drunk and it was recorded and sent to me. Idk how to feel. Im hurt and we are still fighting. What do I do? Should I let this slide?

119,8khq86,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8khq86/my_26f_student_teacher_24m_went_to_dinner_with_my/,My (26F) student teacher (24M) went to dinner with my (high school) students and bad mouthed me. I’m not sure how to salvage my relationship with my students.,"This isn’t the typical relationship advice post, but I’m hoping you guys can help me figure out where to go from here. I am a high school choir teacher who recently hosted a student teacher. Long story short, this guy was a disaster. He showed a lot of potential in terms of presentation. Funny guy, kids took to him quickly, good overall pacing, etc.

But he missed a ton of days (more sick days than I get in a year) for reasons that were sketchy at best, refused to take any constructive feedback, always taught off the cuff without any preparation, and generally was very unprofessional and immature. For example, he missed 3 days due to a back injury (I found out later that he was doing manual labor during this time that he was “unable to teach”), and he told one of my classes a FULLY DETAILED story about how his ex had cheated on him with his best friend. It definitely seemed like he viewed himself as one of the students rather than a teacher.

Any attempts I made to conference with him were met with arguing. Basically anything I asked him to do (prepare to teach a song, make copies, plan a lesson, etc.) was met with statements like “Whatever, I already do everything anyways.” I was incredibly frustrated with him but I worked hard to hide this from the students. In the last two weeks he told me he was going to be a realtor anyways so I just gave him a C and sent him on his way. 

Today, I found out that he met with some of my students for dinner. During this dinner, he told them that I “hate my job” and I tried to fail him because I’m “jealous” of him. He told them that I talk negatively about them behind their backs and that I didn’t understand his “style of teaching”. 

Three girls in my program brought this to me because they wanted to hear “my side” of things. I’m fuming. All my students really bonded with him, but my boys especially loved him, and he used this bond to try to drive a wedge between me and my students. This may be hard to explain, but as a choir director, my kids and my job mean EVERYTHING to me. I work 70+ hours a week prepping music, organizing field trips and fundraisers, running after school rehearsals, etc. I spend four years with them before they graduate and I help them through family troubles, boyfriends, anxiety, you name it! Now I feel that they are going to question me and my motives because this petulant child decided to knock me down a peg. 

I don’t know which students specifically were there when he went on his anti-me rant, but I got the impression it was quite a few. Should I address this with all my students? Just a few from the group? Let it go? I want to address this with him too, but I don’t know how to do it without dropping down to his level and being an unprofessional jerk. I want to set a good example for my kids but I really don’t know how. 

Any advice is appreciated.

I don't feel the same way and I hate myself because of it. Please help me figure out what to do!,"So I'm not trying to sound like a sob story, and I'm sorry for the length, but I just want honest help. So people of Reddit here is my story: 

Two months ago I [20 M] broke it off with my girlfriend [20 F] of a year. We weren't good together, she isolated me, I wasn't there for her enough, and eventually it led to her cheating on me with an ex. I was extremely torn up over it and just really started to spiral out after we broke up. She moved on but I never got with anyone else. I talked to other girls but nothing ever came of it. Eventually I became ok with being by myself and didnt need anyone else for happiness. 


So one month into the breakup she texted me and said she was getting rid of a dog we got (I know sooo stupid for getting one together so young) together because she wanted to move. She found him a great new home and I couldnt have taken care of it so it really was for the best, but at the time I was extremely angry. I said some awful things to her basicly shaming her for her choice. This was horrible of me and I deeply regret it. This is where the fuckup starts. Four days ago I texted her and apoligized for all the things I said because I should have never in a million years put her through that. She then asked if we could meet up and talk in person. I agreed and we met at a bagel shop. We talked and discussed some things and were on good terms again. She then calls me two days later and said that her and her new boyfreind had broken up and she needed help (I have a sneaking suspession she dumped him because I was being freindly and communicating again). Being the idiot I am i said ""just go help her its the least you can do"". So I went to her house and she was bawling and I hugged her. She kissed me and then it was on. In the moment I told her I still love her, which is true. She says she is still in love with me. I stay late into the night before I go home. The next day comes and I was out with some freinds. She called me again and asked if I could come over. I went over and she told me she needed me and missed me so much. We have sex again and I stayed the night. We talked about how hard getting back together would be because of how messy our split was, but she said she wants me and only me. She is starting school in June and she says she really cant deal with loosing me before that.  


I know we are way to young for all of this and I really wish I still wanted to be with her, but I don't. I need to be alone and grow before I am in a relationship again. It makes me sick to my stomach that I told her I loved her because it is going to break her heart again and I don't want that for her. I hate myself for ever finding a way back into this situation. I feel like I am a monster and I deserve to never have someone love me again. I do still love her but I know we cant be together. I have made a counseling appointment on next Thursday to try and make sure I never do this to someone again, and I will do as many sessions as I have to. I just don't know how to break this to her. If she were to hurt herself or something I could never live with myself. I just don't know what to do. Do I stay trapped with her and be half in half out just to please her, or do I work on myself? Please help me.

I met this girl years ago on Myspace (of course we don't use that shit now).  We hit it off, but never acted upon it.  We knew the same people, grew up in the same neighborhood, went to the same schools but we've never met.  She's a few years younger than I, if you're wondering why.  She was a freshman in college when we met online.  Fast forward about 10-11 years...  We're all grown up now (I'm in my early 30's, she's in her upper 20's).  Over the past year, we've gotten bolder with each other as far as talking about our sexual desires (no sexting) and even expressing our desire to have sex with one another... nothing vulgar - just vague expression, light flirting and hypnotic suggestions being planted.

So, she left her boyfriend (who was an asshole) and moved away from him, starting her life anew in a new state (3 hours from me).  She hit me up earlier in the week asking what I would be doing this weekend, because she'd be near our hometown for work and she wants to see me.  Naturally, we set up a date to finally meet.  But I'm extremely nervous.  She just texted me and said she was on the way.  So, apparently, this is happening.

Now, don't get me wrong I'm no virgin nor inexperienced.  I've been pretty successful with women, probably more than the average guy.  I've even met women online before and ended up in a four year relationship with one of them.  I'm not the type of guy that gets rattled by women.

But this one, idk.  I'm extremely nervous.  She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen both inside AND out... telling you all on a scale of 1-10 she's a 15 on her worst day.  That's pressure enough, but I just don't want to ruin anything.  I'm essentially poor and down in hard times (she knows that) and I have nothing to offer her but me... literally.  I've never been in this position before.  I'm not expecting love at first sight or anything, but my nerves are on the way to becoming shot lol

Or should we hang out after moving in? Would it be weird if I approached them and asked them out? I'm only in contact with guy renting the rooms, so I could only tell him ""Hey, let's do the future roommates meetup"". Or should I just don't care? I would like to hang out with them, but I don't want to be weird or annoying. 

Yes, I'm overthinking everything and yes I'm terrible with people.

We've been together just over 2 years, and were engaged in February. He's a uniquely quirky individual with a complex and stoic exterior, but very silly and playful around me when we're happy. He can be very brash, stubborn and condescending to me, while I'm very sensitive and introverted. He's guarded and I'm an open book. I'm very active, oriented to take care of the home/family, and he's very focused on himself, gaming, and his friends.  There are times when I feel like we complement each other since we're on opposite sides of the spectrum, but more often, we're butting heads because we can't get on the same page. 

He makes it very clear that he's unavailable to me 4\+ days a week to be exclusively with his friends or to game. When he does make time for me, we're still with his friends and/or I'm waiting for him to get off his computer or I'm irritated because I've been waiting for him to want to be around me. He basically still has a bachelor mentality and I'm trying to cultivate a family atmosphere. He does very little to help at home, and I'm stuck doing 90&#37; of the housework. He's made it clear that he wants to be in our relationship, as I've asked him on several occasions if he'd rather be alone. I'm losing faith in us because I express my need for his attention and time, and he continues to blow it off. He's selfish with his time, and I'm often left waiting up all hours of the night. I'm developing serious trust issues and starting to doubt everything he tells me. It's so upsetting. I love him and work hard to be the best partner I can be for him. I feel like he takes advantage of my dedication and loyalty, by assuming I have no backbone and will never leave him. I'm lonely and reaching out to him often for attention. He thanks me for telling him when I'm down, but nothing ever changes on his end. I'm feeling like he's not capable of being the man I need him to be, even though he's told me he wants to be. The truth is, he's been a bachelor most of his life, and always very independent. I need to know if I should be hopeful and stick it out or start to think about life without him. It kills me to even think about it, but I'm exhausted by our situation. How do I get through to him so he'll better understand my side?

I'm glad to see so many responses. Thank you all for your support!

Each one of your questions and advices  made me think about my future life. Yes, I'm stupid to struggle to convince my parents for marriage alone, I'm stupid to work hard to get into schools in USA, where my my bf was working, and I'm dumb to leave all my friends and family behind in India for my dream married life with my husband!

I have worked hard to be in this position in my life, I have found a new job, which I'm going to start soon. The major guilt I have is, my husband supported me financially for my Masters and helped in ghost writing my Thesis as my English is poor and he didn't like my draft;  I see this is a lot of sacrifice from a partner, I believe that I should live with him for these reasons. I observe he is good for everyone except me, so he is a not a bad person. But, it was a nightmare on how I  completed my Thesis and  looked out for a job 2 years ago, when he left me in middle of my Thesis documentation without talking to me for weeks after a fight, where I was losing confidence day by day, though I never gave up. I feel I'm more independent as I no longer take his help since last  2 years as he ill treats me. Also, to come out of debt feeling, I paid 70% of the amount to buy his dream motorhome from my first year's earnings and savings, which is more than he spent for my studies.

I really cannot think of having children, they growing up seeing their mother being abused, they learning it's okay to abuse, and what if they start ignoring me, and think I'm dumb with their father's influence? It literally scares me! :(

I'm planing to reach out to my friends who know both me and my husband. I'm making points from this discussion forum to discuss with my husband, try to convince him for counselling, and understand if he is willing to change, I'm ready to compromise on his wishes if they are reasonable. Meanwhile, I'm trying to find a place if things fall apart badly.

I really want to give my best to work this relationship if there is any chance left, I definitely need your continued support and I will keep you all posted.

-------------------------------------------------------------
I am a 30 year old female, Indian, and married for almost 5 years now.

I grew up with a protective middle class family with a younger sister, in a rural place.

I was never a smart kid, but I had a very supportive parents, who took care of every needs, which helped me being successful in studies and in my career. I used to work really hard, study all time (only course materials), otherwise I don't think I could get good grades at schools. I continued to work hard until l get my  bachelor's degree.

I was a girl without much exposure to real world,  never had a bf, no party or any social activities, other than meeting relatives or attending functions at their houses.

Once I started working in India, I met a guy at work, he's now my husband. We were friends, I never had a friend who was a boy, I became close to him as he wanted help for his higher studies, and he was going through a tough time due to break up. I genuinely thought,  as a good friend I can help him succeed, and never had thought of marrying him as I wanted to marry a guy my parents arrange.

Things started changing, we started hanging out, but never had a bf-gf relationship, he even went to USA for studies. But, I continued to help him in his studies and give company as he was lonely,  and at that time we decided to marry. He was the only boy friend in my life. I struggled a lot to convince my parents,  later planned to study further in USA, which made my parents to agree for marriage and I came to USA to pursue Masters.

Just to remind, I was never a smart kid, but I don't compromise in studies and grades. So, again I started working really hard, which messed up my marriage life a bit, because my husband is not my parents, and he doesn't know that I need to work hard to succeed. He is smart, his expectations are very high, and he was not happy about me spending most of my time in studies.

We started to fight a lot, he used to get very angry on everything I do, also I was beaten up couple of times. Then, we moved to different places for job, stayed separately for a while,  and we are back together again, I can say it's 2.5 years, we are living together.  Now he knows that I'm not smart, and I work hard to succeed. But, we are being unhappy most of the time because of my inability to handle things in right way,  he needs perfection in everything, be it be my English, driving car, looking at the map, even while communicating we fight. I'm trying hard, and I feel I've improved and changed a lot, all my friends, sister, and family are proud of me and the changes in me. But, it's still not up to my husband's expectation. 

I'm really sorry to write such a long history and story, but I'm at my breaking point, I've lost confidence in myself, I lost my job recently, I don't see myself as successful person as I feel being constantly judged and criticized at every steps of my life.  My husband thinks good for me, he wants me to succeed, he has never cheated me. But, he always calls me dumb, don't take my words seriously anymore,  I feel being controlled at every action, yells at me, not polite, and we don't even have sex that often, he doesn't trust that I'll be a good mother because of my incompetence. He's not ready to settle down, not ready for a baby, gets irritated if I talk about buying a house.

I don't believe in divorce or separating. But, I need advice if there is any chance for me to work out with my partner and  have a good marriage life?

128,8kgw92,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kgw92/different_opinions_from_two_therapists_help/,Different opinions from two therapists. Help.,"So let me give a little background before continuing. About a month ago I broke up with my ex. It wasn't a pretty break up, it was long and drawn out. That, and the relationship as a whole, made me realize that I had some problems internally so I've been seeing a therapist since. This therapist focuses on anxiety, depression, and relationships which is perfect for me. I'm 3 sessions in and have my 4th this Tuesday. I've been doing a lot of growing up and learning so much about myself. I should've done this sooner.

Anyway, during the relationship my gf was seeing a therapist for reasons about her and the relationship. The thing is, this therapist was quickly dismissing our relationship. She was not a fan of us being together. I can't tell you exactly what she told her therapist, but the therapist basically told her that I was abusive and that I was doing things to put her down constantly. Even if I was playing around or trying to make a joke, the therapist would tell her that it wasn't a joke but a remark to put her down. It's not true. Her therapist really planted so much into her mind. She would bring it up whenever we argued, and I had nothing to defend myself with because it was easily dismissed with a, ""my therapist said..."" I feel like it wasn't helping our relationship at ALL.

I didn't want to dismiss her therapist so quickly either, since she is a professional, but it bothered me SO much.

The bottom line is this therapist gave her the idea that I was truly abusive, and I started thinking that I was a shit person.

Now my therapist sees our interactions completely different. At this point I really think he understands how she and I were. Especially who I am as a person.

I've told him about the jokes that I made, the times that I was trying to play around, and he would say things like, ""Well, were you trying to put her down?"" Of course not. I truly loved and cared about her. She was my world and he agrees with me when I say that.

I think the most glaring difference between our therapists shows whenever I tell my therapist about her... She wasn't super nice to me 100&#37; of the time, there were definitely times when she put me down and said things that hurt me, and she was more up front. I always believed that she wasn't trying to hurt me, but it came off that way a lot.

I've told him about those times, and instead of dismissing the relationship and saying that we were bad for each other, he replies with, ""You understand why she said that, right?"" ""She wasn't trying to be mean to you"" ""She was probably more accustomed to that and is expecting you to be that way too"" etc.

I understand what he was saying, and it made me appreciate him so so much.

Now here's where I'm stuck: I'm not sure who to believe. Am I really a bad person, is my therapist just telling me things I want to hear, or am I actually a good person?

\(Side note: I believe if her therapist hadn't made her believe those things, I would've felt more confident and comfortable in the relationship and we'd still be together. It really ate away at me knowing that my own girlfriend thinks I was purposely being abusive. It killed my confidence, and after she told me those things I started feeling depressed, and overall unhappy. If she and I were to try and get back together this would be one of the things I'd like to get cleared out.\)

TL;DR: Her therapist made her believe that I was abusive. She and I started believing it. My therapist thinks otherwise and thinks the things I did were not actually bad, but misinterpreted. Don't know who to believe.","['different', 'opinion', 'therapist', 'help', 'let', 'little', 'background', 'continue', 'month', 'ago', 'break', 'ex', 'pretty', 'break', 'long', 'draw', 'relationship', 'realize', 'problem', 'internally', 'see', 'therapist', 'therapist', 'focus', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'relationship', 'perfect', '3', 'session', '4th', 'tuesday', 'lot', 'grow', 'learn', 'soon', 'relationship', 'gf', 'see', 'therapist', 'reason', 'relationship', 'thing', 'therapist', 'quickly', 'dismiss', 'relationship', 'fan', 'tell', 'exactly', 'tell', 'therapist', 'therapist', 'basically', 'tell', 'abusive', 'thing', 'constantly', 'play', 'try', 'joke', 'therapist', 'tell', 'joke', 'remark', 'true', 'therapist', 'plant', 'mind', 'bring', 'argue', 'defend', 'easily', 'dismiss', 'therapist', 'say', 'feel', 'like', 'help', 'relationship', 'want', 'dismiss', 'therapist', 'quickly', 'professional', 'bother', 'line', 'therapist', 'give', 'idea', 'truly', 'abusive', 'start', 'think', 'shit', 'person', 'therapist', 'see', 'interaction', 'completely', 'different', 'point', 'think', 'understand', 'especially', 'person', 'tell', 'joke', 'time', 'try', 'play', 'thing', 'like', 'try', 'course', 'truly', 'love', 'care', 'world', 'agree', 'think', 'glaring', 'difference', 'therapist', 'show', 'tell', 'therapist', 'super', 'nice', '100&#37', 'time', 'definitely', 'time', 'say', 'thing', 'hurt', 'believe', 'try', 'hurt', 'come', 'way', 'lot', 'tell', 'time', 'instead', 'dismiss', 'relationship', 'say', 'bad', 'reply', 'understand', 'say', 'right', 'try', 'mean', 'probably', 'accustomed', 'expect', 'way', 'etc', 'understand', 'say', 'appreciate', 'here', 'stick', 'sure', 'believe', 'bad', 'person', 'therapist', 'tell', 'thing', 'want', 'hear', 'actually', 'good', 'person', 'note', 'believe', 'therapist', 'believe', 'thing', 'feel', 'confident', 'comfortable', 'relationship', 'eat', 'away', 'know', 'girlfriend', 'think', 'purposely', 'abusive', 'kill', 'confidence', 'tell', 'thing', 'start', 'feel', 'depressed', 'overall', 'unhappy', 'try', 'thing', 'like', 'clear', 'tl;dr', 'therapist', 'believe', 'abusive', 'start', 'believe', 'therapist', 'think', 'think', 'thing', 'actually', 'bad', 'misinterpret', 'know', 'believe']"

I wouldn't say I am necessarily an atheist; however, for the most part, i dont really believe in god, nor do I think that god has an influence on how events lay out. The other part of me is just that religion has very little priority in my life and as a result, i dont think/care enough to invest toward any religion. 

I dated someone very seriously who was orthodox jewish and that ended up not working out bc of religion. My question is, specifically with people who believe in Jesus, how well does it work out if someone, who is in the range of barely religious to decently religious, dates someone like me, who is pretty much not religious? I celebrate all the major holdiays, like christmas and easter and stuff like that, but it's more of a cultural thing, rather than a religious thing. I guess, in general, I have no problem celebrating holidays from a cultural perspective, whether it's christian holidays or jewish ones. It's more of the ""god aspect"" that there may be an issue. 

I have a feeling the compatibility between someone like me with someone who believes in Jesus is probably better than me with someone jewish but I have very little knowledge on this subject and am a little nervous about that bc im scared that the religion barrier will always be a block for me.

We met at a young age when our lives were beginning to form and mold and change in different ways. He had very recently graduated college, and started his first big boy job just about a week before I had met him. I was not even fully out of my previous very toxic and abusive relationship when we had our first date.



Sparks flew so strong and so quick, and I fell hard... We took it slow and became exclusive maybe 6 months later. Those first 6 months were one of the best times of my life. Everything was fresh and new and we were enamored with each other. Then of course the honey-moon phase did just that.. phased out. 
We moved in together about 8 months ago under stressful and not so ideal conditions. Things happened so quickly and he needed to make the crucial decision to re-sign his lease, or move in with me. Not to mention I was having horrible anxiety and multiple panic attacks a week.



Needless to say, moving in together brought even more things to the surface. His anxiety and depression, my anxiety and depression, our polar opposite opinions and differences. The spark and the fun is gone, and it's just been such a struggle for what seems like forever. 


We both have such a deep love and respect for one another, and we communicate just about everything that crosses our minds.  We've been going to therapy (individually and as a couple), we've experienced with psychedelics, we've discussed radical options like moving across the country or teaching abroad in hopes of rekindling some kind of passion and excitement, but nothing seems to be working.



Going from thinking that the universe brought us together for a reason and that he is the man I'm going to spend the rest of my life with to having had the heart-breaking discussion today that breaking up could very well be a possibility if things don't change is, well, heartbreaking...  


I guess my question is, is this normal for a couple in their mid-twenties who both seem to be going through some existential crisis? Is there anything we could be doing differently or better? I know what they mean now when they say that relationships are hard and require a lot of work... but when/where do we draw the line? 
I'm exhausted and I feel like the life is draining out of me, working on this seemingly failing relationship. 


Could anybody please offer me some insight so maybe then I won't feel so lost and hopeless? 


Many thanks guys :)

However, she has a seriously delicate ego. She can rag on me and be full of mischief to me all day long and i'll love it even though she's being a nuisance, however the moment i start to do the same with her she gets very tetchy and if i continue after a warning flag she gets pissed. 

she also doesn't take it well at all when i ask for space, i'm her first boyfriend \(she's 24 and a dr\). she wants to video chat me/ me phone her as soon as i get home and doesn't understand it when i say i need 30 mins after getting home to cool down. It doesn't matter what time we start talking in the evenings\(we're long distance seeing each other every 6 weeks\) but i can't say ""i'm just going to relax this evening before bed, I love you, good night"" i must be actively falling asleep or going to bed straight after i hang up for her not to get moody and tetchy. don't get me wrong, i love talking to her but an hour is the minimum we talk EVERY night and sometimes i'm just not up to 2\-4 hours, i'm a medical student and sometimes i've had a rough day and just need me time\(i have fuck all me time as i study a shit load too and am in final year\).

Am i being cruel because i don't talk more? i need a LOT less contact with her than she does me, i love her to bits but i need to goof off to recharge not talk for hours like she does. I just worry that i'm in the wrong here somehow and it'd help if some random stranger said i was or wasn't an ass.","['girlfriend', 'heighten', 'emotion', 'vent', 'people', 'opinion', 'year', 'half', 'relationship', 'wonderful', 'thoughtful', 'kind', 'hint', 'need', 'help', 'jump', 'amazing', 'support', 'mode', 'seriously', 'delicate', 'ego', 'rag', 'mischief', 'day', 'long', 'love', 'nuisance', 'moment', 'start', 'get', 'tetchy', 'continue', 'warning', 'flag', 'get', 'pissed', 'ask', 'space', 'boyfriend', '24', 'dr', 'want', 'video', 'chat', 'me/', 'phone', 'soon', 'home', 'understand', 'need', '30', 'min', 'get', 'home', 'cool', 'matter', 'time', 'start', 'talk', 'evening', 'long', 'distance', 'see', '6', 'week', 'go', 'relax', 'evening', 'bed', 'love', 'good', 'night', 'actively', 'fall', 'asleep', 'go', 'bed', 'straight', 'hang', 'moody', 'tetchy', 'wrong', 'love', 'talk', 'hour', 'minimum', 'talk', 'night', '2', '-4', 'hour', 'medical', 'student', 'rough', 'day', 'need', 'time', 'fuck', 'time', 'study', 'shit', 'load', 'final', 'year', 'cruel', 'talk', 'need', 'lot', 'contact', 'love', 'bit', 'need', 'goof', 'recharge', 'talk', 'hour', 'like', 'worry', 'wrong', 'help', 'random', 'stranger', 'say', 'ass']"

I’ve had a few relationships in the past which were quite long but simply didn’t have a future. Now, I’ve been dating this girl for about a month. All is pretty good, she’s very sweet and I’m really enjoying her company. Downside is that I get in arguments on a daily base because, well, I can be hard to handle sometimes. I’m quite jealous, but not very controlling. I dont mind my girlfriend going out or chilling with friends, or whatever. It’s just that, I sometimes jump to weird conclusions and automatically think that she prefers other guy(s) because I can’t offer anything special. I feel like this because I’m quite insecure. Whenever I bring this up however, she claims that she loves me, and me only. But it’s nearly impossible for me to actually believe her, which sometimes upsets her. As a result I’ve noticed that I’ve been debating wether or not I should be in a relationship at all.

We have been dating for two years. I was pretty heartbroken but I went through day to day until one evening he calls me genuinely heartbroken as well and told me how much he missed me and how much he missed us and I was everything he wanted. I confessed that I still loved him as well and ended up driving down to his town to see him. We ended up reconnecting and I was over the moon. The next two months I went and flew down again and we had made plans for this weekend to see each other. Honestly, he is/was everything I wanted and I love him more than I did before.

 He drops a BOMB on me a couple days ago. He tells me he has to confess something. He tells me he booked a room for us but he has to be honest with me. He met someone right before we got back together and now he does not know what to do. Apparently while winning me back he had someone in the background as well.

 I am CRUSHED. Torn apart, heart ripped out of the chest, cant sleep or eat, utter mess. I was planning my future with this person, thought this person was the person I was going to marry and be together with for the rest of my life. All I want to do is go see him and fix us. He wants me to come down as well, but has to let me know there is someone else too. To be honest I am TERRIFIED of losing him I love him.

With that out of the way, I'd like to preface this with the following: I'm a 19 year old male, mixed race with a father from a Christian background and a mother from a Muslim background. Both of them are devout Muslims and I have been for about 14 years now. So, why am I saying this? Well, I have grown more distanced from what I call; ""the bearded man in the sky"" as I grew and became more exposed to this magical idea of free thought and other explanations for the coming of the world alongside years and years of being force-fed religious rhetoric and although, I've continued to follow the religion (at least in their presence) I've draw more and more away from it, eventually I've become more of someone who despises the religion more than anything and how they place so much emphasis on worshiping this all powerful being that craves validation. I've let it slip that I don't really belive in it anymore but, I want to really let them know.

136,8kfymh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kfymh/why_would_my_boyfriend_always_blame_me_and_make/,Why would my boyfriend always blame me and make me feel like something's wrong with me?,"I have a boyfriend for 5 months now. The problem is that if he feels hurt or something botheres him about me most of the time he doesn't share with me and one of the options happen-whether he explodes(because he kept it too much to himself like one time he broke up with me because couple of things bothered him& it was too much for him apparently because it added up overtime, we started to argue and he just broke up with me-but got back 2 weeks later he said he did a mistake), or he shares with me later, or he doesn't share with me AT ALL.

I always was telling him to share with me things and in our last meet up something small bothered him but instead of sharing with me he was cold, at that day when we went to sleep he just turned around with his back to me.. It was really hurtful. I talked to him about it next day(it came up from him somehow) I explained to him that it's important for me to talk about things and he kinda ""yes yes"" me sounded like he didn't care. But at the end of the conversation he said ""OK"" but somewhere in my heart I didn't feel he understood.
Well when I got back home it still bothered me I felt the conversation wasn't closed cuz he didn't really understand me.
Through text he understood something's wrong with me and I told him I'll talk to him about it. 

Then we talked on the phone and I explained to him that even though I had a lot of fun on that weekend it's still bothers me and it sits on my mind, because he turned around when we went to sleep and I felt he was distancing from me and I want us to talk about things and I want to feel free to talk and the same to him, cuz sometimes it can really hurt in the end **that's what I told him**(the result like he was turned around when we went to sleep). 

He reacted something like ""what?? What's wrong with you, it seems like you're searching something to argue about!"". No matter how much I explained to him that I only want to talk about it so we can figure it out together he was like a block.. He told me ""I don't feel like I'm talking to you anymore, what's wrong with you?? I feel like I'm talking to you when you are sick! Do you want to talk later it seems like you're searching problems in our relationship! What's this shit?? Why did you bring this shit?? Look what you've done to me! I'm pissed off, I wasn't even cold to you. Are you on drugs??? What's wrong with you?"". He told me ""I don't understand you. We already talked about it on the weekend why are you returning to this subject again?"" (on the Saturday that we talked about him telling me if something botheres him). 

No matter how much I explained that it's OK maybe I was wrong about him being cold at that night when we went to sleep maybe It only seemed like it but it still really botheres me that we don't talk about things he just couldn't listen, he told me ""are we done talking about it? Are you done?"" I told him ""yes.."" feeling bad and unwanted, I tried to move on from the conversation with talking about his day but he was cold. So then he told me ""I don't want to talk right now"" and then we hung up, he wrote me a text immediately ""don't know how I gave you this impression that I was distancing from you, you can talk to me freely about things, I'm sorry you felt that way"". 

I just didn't reply.. I was hurt because of how much he was aggressive to me, I felt like he was making me sound crazy and like I need a psychiatrist.. He sent me 3 text of saying good night etc..
He tried to call me the next day, I didn't answer. Day after even though I was willing to answer him I felt it's about time to talk he just didn't call or text and the same thing yesterday and today.
What I really want from him is understand the hurtful things he said to me and accept my emotions and my worries about our relationship even if he doesn't agree he could at least try to understand me.

I don't know what's wrong with him.. I don't know, what should I do? Is he playing games with me? Is it called emotional abuse? Why did he act that disrespectful and so blaming towards me?

Post-break up relationship.,"Me and my ex have been dating for 4 years before we broke up(we've had multiple break ups before, but this is the most recent). I ended things 2 months ago. This came in the context of a career crisis and at the same time we have a relationship crisis because we were long distance for sometime earlier in the year and it was still not really solved by the time things with my career started to take a turn for the worse. 

She started dating a friend of hers two weeks after we broke up. And eventually I sorted things out on my side and I wanted to fight for her back and really apologize for the break up(1 month post break up) So I spoke with her and was quite vulnerable about things and she blew me off. We cut things off for 2 weeks after that. She contacted me(1.5 months post break up). It was not really an invite back in but she stated that she was still confused about things. And we got to talking and have been taking for the last 2 weeks and went out a few times(for the last week). She is still kind of dating this guy at this time. I proposed to her that we give it a shot being exclusive for a week to go out on romantic dates and really try things again and see if its worth it. She is worried about things not working and losing this new guy as well and being left really alone this time if things don't work out.  She wants to hang out with me but she said she cannot be exclusive with me right now and can only offer to hang out. The issue is I'm leaving again soon for another 2 months(usually she flys to see me). And I feel like if we don't solve things before I leave it really will have to end permanently.

We saw each other several times a week but not an unreasonable amount since we both have 9-5 jobs. Sex was amazing, communication on point, we got each other on all these levels, just the whole 9. While things were progressing I learned about her past, she was in an 8 year marriage with a narcissist who emotionally and sexually abused her. She called and finalized the divorce about a year before we met. I figured this was plenty of time to get over the marriage enough and she confirmed she was over her ex and wanted nothing to do with him. During my getting to know her she started saying how she was trying to figure herself out and what she wanted in her personal life. Mind you, this wasn't including us necessarily, just she told me about how being with a narcissist forced her to devote so much emotional time and energy to that toxic relationship. I understood and I didn't pressure us to get closer. Plus we had only been dating a few month so I didn't feel comfortable being ""facebook official"" yet anyways.

Around febuary I get this big long message from her. For some background I have depression, I mean who doesn't. Due to it being exceptionally bad last year because of several trauma's leading up I now make it a point to practice self care. Taking myself on dates, relaxing, etc. I told her about one of these self care days I was going to do (I think I was just going to take myself out to eat and see a movie) and this prompted her message. She essentially said ""You brought up self care and that has made me realize that I need to figure a lot of things out still. I'm not ready for a relationship but I'd like to be friends if possible"". We later talked in person and came to the understanding that we'd still be dating just would keep things as is without leading towards something more serious for the time being. Which I was totally cool with and understood.

Flash forward to April, she just disappears. We talked just about everyday and while she wouldn't always answer (nor did I expect her to) she'd always get back to me later in the day. This was a solid 4-5 days of nothing. It got to the point that I was worried about her safety, except that'd see her on facebook as recently logged in so I know she was alive just not participating in society. I called/texted for a few days and finally messaged her asking ""Do you even want me in your life anymore? It’s been a week and I haven’t heard anything from you. I don’t know what’s going on or what happened just please talk to me and tell me what’s up.""

She responded almost immediately saying that she felt like a complete bitch and that she's been dealing with breakdowns and her anxiety. She made no excuses and owned up. She cut herself off from the world and wanted to disappear. That she can't keep hanging on to the past and let the people that care about her into her life and her heart. We talked that night. I forgave her, asked what happened and made her promise to a) never do that again and b) to talk to me. Even if it's just ""hey I need to be alone for a while"" like just talk to me and let a dude know what's up.

Everything was good for a week then again she ghosts. I text her Last friday to see if we were still on for a date we had and I get back ""I'm sorry. But no. I can't do this. You're a great guy and you deserve better. I have to walk away""

That was the last I've heard from her. I texted her and just said "" I don't know what's going on. But fuck what people deserve. Me and you have a connection that doesn't come around all that often. Why are you walking away from something that makes you so undenyably happy? I'm not going to message you anymore until you decide to message back. Whether it's tomorrow or 10 years from now that invite is open"". 

I got a read receipt from facebook so I know she saw it. She unfriended me but didn't block. I just don't understand. She's been so happy everytime we're together. She promised she wouldn't do something like this again. That she'd talk to me. If she didn't care, why'd she come help me paint my apartment last week? Why do all of these actions and then give some bullshit excuse about ""not deserving me"". I know I should walk away and move on but.....fuck just why???

I will start from the beginning...he opened up to me about 1 year or so ago regarding his interest in cross-dressing. I was in shock, and a little weirded out (as this was out of nowhere), but tried to remain supportive. I even went out with him to buy clothes, make-up, and any other items he wanted to try out. However, as I was supportive, I was also very uncomfortable with the idea because he wasn't able to explain to me why he had such an interest.
He would always ask me to be involved in the process, doing hair, make-up, taking photos, etc. and again that made me feel uncomfortable. I spoke with him about this, and told him that I did not really want to see him doing the cross-dressing, and especially did not want to partake in any of it. To clarify, I did not ask him to stop, I just did not want to be a part of it or see it. This ultimately lead to arguments because he did not understand why I wouldn't ""accept"" it, and was so bothered by it.
Fast forward a few months...he told me he was going to stop because he didn't have the desire to do it anymore. 
Well this has now been 6 months since he has said this but I recently found a box where he had purchased a wig, and heels. I have never mentioned the box but I asked him if he had started to cross-dress again, and he told me no. I also find that my make-up has been messed with and clothing of mine in random places that I know I would never leave them. 
I am wondering if I should be concerned that he is hiding this from me, and lying to me about it considering I asked him straight up. Our relationship has not been the best, and this just seems to be another small lie. It is making me question a lot of other things, but I don't know if I am over-reacting therefore I wanted to get some outside advice.

How would you discipline.,"A couple of weeks ago I asked my daughter to do her chores and she was irritated that I was standing too close to her and she punched me in the eye leaving me with a bruise for over a week. I took away her phone and computer for an indefinite amount of time. She has broken pretty much every rule that we have in the house which are very simple:
-30 minute break to eat or watch TV when you come home from school
-homework is then started after the break
-after homework each child has one sometimes two small chores to do after that
-they also must keep a tidy room every day. 
*Any child that has a phone must maintain A and B grades, my daughter has had two D’s since December. She has also been caught on multiple occasions sending inappropriate pictures or receiving inappropriate pictures and having inappropriate conversations with other teens.

Then they’re allowed to do whatever they want for the rest of the evening where. that’s Xbox play on the phone watch TV they’re free to do what they want within reason.

Ever since this happened she has been asking me every single day when she’s going to get her things back, to which I already responded if you continue to ask me it’s going to take longer to get it back.

I told all of my children that they are going to be many rule changes within the house and how things are done because I used to be a pushover and they would take it advantage of that.

Yesterday my daughter smarted off to me about something else so I took away her make up and her Roku. I told her when she is mature and responsible enough to get her daily tasks done and be respectful she can have her things back. 

I am taking her to our family therapist as well as having neuropsychological testing done .

Based on the reviews I get it's clear that I know how to choose my words given unlimited time.  But in practice I'm more timid, because I can never fully dismiss the anxiety of saying something goofy and ruining the sexiness of the moment.

Maybe I'm holding myself to unrealistic standards.  After all, I can't recall ever being with a partner who said much of anything during sex \-\- let alone anything horribly erotic \-\- and it's not reasonable to expect myself to role\-play at the level of the scripted interactions of characters in a story or a porn shoot.

I need help trying to change my ways.","For context, I'm a 20 year old male, and I cheated on my 25 y.o. boyfriend. We had a relationship for 1.5 years, and I ended it because I felt like I needed to change my ways before I ever go into a relationship ever in my life. I've always been against people that cheat on their partners, and then I found out I am one of those people; I feel disgusted in myself, and horrible for the way I made him feel.

My ex was \*\*SO\*\* good to me in the relationship. They gave me money when I needed it, they made me feel confident in myself, they were a positive light in my life. Of course I also gave back all my love, support, affection, and money. The problem is my immature, childish, grudge\-holding attitude. Every time we got in an argument, where either of us could be correct, I would hold such a grudge until I got my revenge. My ""revenge"" a couple of times was to break up with him and sleep around. This time, I did the unthinkable and straight up cheated on him, which I feel horrible about. I broke up with him because I just hated that he would always take me back after I did such horrible things.

I'm normally a good person, but my mind just dives into the deepest pit of anger and vengeance whenever I feel like something wrong was done against me. I forget all the redeeming qualities that my amazing ex has & all of the good they've done for me, and just think of all the bad they've done. I lose my ability to rationalize and I just act on my emotions without thinking. I don't get physical I just become distanced, I sulk, and I plan my revenge. It is literally the worst quality of mine, and Idk how to change it. 

I feel like this might stem from something in my childhood. All I can think of is probably the way my parents would wrongfully get angry at me, and I was just forced to bite my tongue and seethe in anger. Maybe it's something else. I also like to tell myself ""I'm just young and childish, I need time to mature and grow out of it."", but I hate giving myself excuses.

As she works the front of the restaurant he says stuff like “when are you gonna dump your boyfriend so I can take you on a date?”. 

Don’t get it twisted I know my place and I’m not one to get super jealous or aggressive. When she first brought it up I told her “that’s funny, you should tell that guy I said what’s up” just to let her know I’m aware of it, don’t approve of it but I’m also not going to get super upset. 

I then proceeded to tell her if he made her feel uncomfortable she should tell me or management because that’s not okay, and she agreed. 

Then just yesterday she brought up something like the guy keeps passing by saying things like: “you’re breaking my heart just dump him”. 

So then I got to thinking, why does this keep coming up between me and her? 

I’m not going to tell her to stop talking to him because regardless, if she wants to talk to him she will, they work together. 

So my question is, how should I address this? 

Should I go meet the dude at her restaurant?

Im a 24yr old male who basically just finished having and affair with a 25yr old female in which i didn't know from the beginning. When we first met and went out she told me she was going through a divorce and she was going through separation process. Well we started hitting it off pretty well honestly too well, and one date led to another, then dates led to making out  then that led to sex and meeting up after work. Well here's the thing I literally told this woman everything that I wouldn't even be comfortable to tell my own brother. I was a virgin before then, and i never really experienced someone actually liking me like she did it was an all new feeling that i always wondered what it felt like. She told me things like I don't want to be with nobody else but you, sent me videos and pictures and she even said she told her closet sister about how good i was to her which made me feel like i was doing something right. Well things kind of turned for a change because apparently she started hanging out with another guy again she slept with about 3 months ago before she met me. She cut it off with the guy before hand and then she started giving him rides to work and hanging out with him again. I asked her if was she having sex with him and she swore up and down she wasn't and that she was just friends. Me knowing how guys think  i know he still have feelings for her and i told her i wanted to break it off because i didnt want to be in no competition. Well she pretty much swinged me back into her arms   because she asked me to let her prove herself and i did. But after all of that i became skeptical and started asking questions about her marriage. Come to find out she was still living with her husband which i knew  but not sleeping with him and she hadn't even filed for divorce yet which i didnt know. She made a valid point tho the reason why she still lived with him is because she was waiting on the job to make her pernament and because of their child. Well here in the past week she found out her husband was cheating on her and and she tried to make it work with him but he wouldn't change now shes all an emotional wreck. While she is still hanging out with this other guy, i was too being a dummy i guess but nothing sexual. I realized how much i ended up liking her and i told her i still wanted to be more than friends and she basically told me last night at work she dont know if she does but she still wants to be friends and hang out. I told her i can't be friends with someone ive been intimate with and my hopes was given up because ive really never dated anyone and literally every girl ive tried to be with in the past always had let me down and i feel like its my fault. Honestly im not mad at her at all, but i just feel sorry for her, shes a very nice person to everybody and she has a good heart who will help anyone just like me which is why i liked her so much. But with me im hurt behind this and i feel like im never going to find true love, this seems to happen to me all the time. My question is, should i still try to be friends with her and how do i get over this one??

My ex of 5 years ago contacted me the other day to say she had some books and other stuff of mine that she thought I would want. Asked for my address to mail it back to me. We live in different cities now.

We were together 6 years. Broke up 5ish years ago. We spoke a few years ago last, as we were both having some relationship issues. For her, he was emotionally unavailable and constantly seeing strippers. Mine was similar, sans strippers. Anyways, I broke up with my GF at the time, now my ex engaged to the same guy, getting married in Vegas in a few months.  

Anyways, we both went our separate ways, and never really spoke again, until I got an email the other day. I just find it weird she has this stuff of mine from 5 years ago, and now wants to send it to me. She’s been living with this guy for 2-3 years now. So it’s not like they’re just moving in together and it came up from the basement. I don’t know what the stuff is exactly, but at this point I don’t miss it, if it were me, I’d just toss it out. 

Am I reading too much into this, or is this actually weird?

So I met what I genuinely thought was my dreamguy. He was perfect! He was just the sweetest guy ever, and we had the same values and interests in things. I knew from the second time that I met him that I was going to fall for him. So I did, so hard. He asked me to move in with him really quick, but I was only going to live with him for a month, but then things got more and more serious, so he \(and myself\) didn't want me to move out after a month or two. After I lived at his place for a couple of months we became a couple. And I was so happy! He treated me like a princess, we were together all the time, we didn't want to go outside the bedroom, we were looking at our relationship as ""perfect"" and we agreed that we had to be soulmates. But thing escalated from perfect to not so perfect. He is kind of judgmental of him self, and he started asking me questions about my past, and said that my answers didn't add up to what I had told him before. There were an episode where he made me feel disgusted because he asked me questions about this guy I met two months BEFORE him. He said something like ""Yuck, that was only two months before u met me"" and asked me sexual details about this guy \(If I gave him a BJ and if I swallowed\) and such things. I became really uncomfortable and he had sex with a girl three weeks AFTER he met me, but he had the right to judge me for something I did two months BEFORE I met him? No. I told him that, he also reacted on a comment on this guy that I made. This guy I met before my ex had a really huge penis \(And I am NOT a fan of those\) and when we were drinking with some friends at his place during summer, my girlfriend and he was having an discussion about penises. My friend was comparing a beer can with penises, and my ex responded with ""you are overreacting, there is no such thing as so big penises"" and I replied with ""yes there is because I have experienced it."" He then chooses to bring up this discussion 6 months later and said things like ""girls that say such things are so disgusting"" where I replied that I agreed, but I didn't mean it positive, it was not a positive experience for me. Then he tells me that ""Well, you are not the tightest girl that I have been with, but I don't tell you that"" And he tells me that ""I deserved to hear it"" and ""He meant it only the way I meant it"" and when it's too tight it does hurt for him. So there he had established a feeling inside of me that is not positive, and he made med feel disgusting. He did not want to touch me after this conversation, he just went to bed. I got really upset. We made up the day after, but his questions begun to bother me more and more. I told him my sexual number \(and I lied\) and yeah, I know thats wrong. He also found out something that I should've told him a long time ago. And when he found out I lied about that too. \(This was something really personal, but it has nothing to do with other guys, cheating or something in that category\) and he almost broke up with me that day. I remember thinking ""Oh my God, it can't get any worse than this"" Boy, was I wrong! It went all downhill from there. He went on a vacation and he got drunk, called me and he said all those ugly words to me that made me hung up. I understand that he still was in shock after he found that personal thing out about me, but still. He also said something like ""If she wasn't mine u could have her"" to his friend \(that also heard that\) I hung up and he started calling me a whore etc. That evening I was going to write down more about my past. He could tell that I didn't write down all the truth, and he called me and started to ask me questions, and telling that he would break up with me if I didn't tell the truth. After I \(almost\) told him about everyone he freaked out and called me so many ugly things. For example ""You are such a whore"" ""You are sick"" ""You make me want to throw up"" ""Don't you want to throw up because of yourself, that would be the best reaction"" and so on and so on.. But still he wanted to be together with me. Thing was good for a period of time, until it even got worse. Like.. Really worse. Because I had lied to him so much he told me that I have to be a psychopath, or my feelings for him was just bullshit. I knew that my feelings for him was not bullshit, so then I had to be a psychopath. When he asked me questions about my past, he asked so detailed questions \(like: did u use a condom? And just demanded me to use a condom, where he had almost never used it before. And more questions like did u swallow, what position, what happened, walk me through how it happened, how many have u showered with etc\) and I told him E V E R Y T H I N G right before he broke up with me. He made me feel like I had to tell him things. He went through my Facebook messenger, texts, my computers, my pictures etc. And he told me that ""If I EVER can trust you again I have to look at it"" So I showed him things, and he just went through all the texts with my girlfriends and guys that I have dated. He also called me a pathological liar because I had tricked him, because I was such a whore and I had pretented to be so hard to get when I apparently was not. I told him that my girlfriends was worse than I am, but then he replied with ""You can not compare you with those girls"" I also told him that I didn't lie about that, but I only was telling him how I viewed my self. Then he told me that ""Well I believe you when u say u think u were hard to get, because you're stupid enough to think so"" He also told me that ""You CAN NOT have so high self esteem as u claim"" So he was telling me how I was feeling, and I believed him. He also dragged in my family in this, saying ""This is because of your dad u have been this way"" etc. 

 I already had contacted a psychology that I was going to meet. When I met him I told him how things were, that everything was my fault and that I was going to therapy because I was a psychopath. Oh my, did he open up my eyes! He made me realize things from a whole another view. My ex had been more or less controlling against me for months, but I didn't see it. It was not so noticeable either, but I actually told him that he needed to chill down for a sec when he didn't understand why I had put makeup on before I went to work \(I like to go without makeup and I do that a lot, but sometimes I think its funk to put on makeup\) And he told me that ""I just wanted to know WHY u chose to put on makeup"" He is also that type of person that is always ""right"" and things around the house had to be done in his way, because he knew best. And we had also argued a couple of times because he meant that he had told me things which he DIDNT, or he HADNT told me things and told me that ""I told u that"" I also felt that he did things, while if I had done the same thing he would react. \(for example having an afterparty when I wasn't home\) which I reacted to and was mad at him for, while he was saying things like ""You're overreacting"" ""The only thing I spoke about was you"" etc.

The past month or two we’ve been messaging each other every day, we’ve gone to Thorpe Park together, cinema and met up for lunch a few times and I want to ask her out.

The only issue I’m facing is I’m not sure if she feels the same way about me as I do about her, I’ve been to her house and introduced to her parents, had dinner there etc. Shortly after having dinner there I asked her to the cinema and she gladly accepted and we went with her sister [19F] and her sisters boyfriend [19M] after which she dropped me home. 

Later that evening I asked if she’d want to go to this burger place that’s about half hour out from town, again she accepted the offer quickly and started to reply to a lot of messages with a ‘:)’. We went on Monday, I paid, and went shopping after and we’ve agreed to meet next week to go out for lunch again. 

Each time we’ve met / been out after work it hasn’t actually been called a date explicitly and I’m not sure if she is counting these as dates or if she thinks we’re just friends?

She’s also been on holiday during the period we’ve been talking and got me 4 presents whilst being away (she didn’t get anyone else anything) and I suppose the end question here is: Is this behaviour from someone who wants to be just friends?

For some reason, I'm truely hurt. If he meant ""not yet"" he would have answered that. 

I would not move in together with someone \(SO, ex, or anyone\) if it wouldn't work out and for sure not within the first few years. But yet, 2 years together is a reasonable time to at least plan something. 

We currently live in our apartments \(each approx. 420sqf\) with about 15 min drive from my place to his. spend about 2\-4 nights during the week and every weekend together. Because of the apartment sizes, it's out of question for anyone to move in to the other's apartment. we are both in well paying jobs, financially  stable.

We dated for about 10 months and then moved in together to my aunts house that she rented us. We were there for about 5 months before she had to sell it. 

We then moved to his parents (an hour away from my hometown). He has a camper we live in and were set on doing the full time RV thing but that takes time and money to get going. I wasn’t able to find a job I like out there so I’ve been making the hour commute back and forth. Which has become less taxing as time goes on. I don’t mind the drive as much anymore. But, he himself is a truck driver so he’s gone for days/weeks at a time and I have little contact with anyone out there while I’m there so it’s been very lonely which brings us to our current situation.

I want to move back to my hometown. He doesn’t. Only because he doesn’t want to pay rent for an apartment again, he thinks they’re a waste of money and stupid so he’d rather have me move back to my parents. Which I really do not want to do. I have a dog and two cats so it makes it a little more difficult finding somewhere and finding a roommate is a tad hard in this town. 

So that’s a whole problem in and of itself but also, he doesn’t text me near as much as he used to when he’s gone. He rarely comes home so if this continues while I’m at my parents/moved out on my own, I’m not going to put up with a non-existent relationship. 

I really just don’t know if this is like... a normal situation. All my friends are kind of shocked that he’d rather have me move back to my parents (where he knew I was not happy) instead of finding just a small cheaper place with me. Should I start thinking of moving on? I don’t see him ever leaving his parents anytime soon and he’s already 28... I’m ready to settle down and start a family and he seems nowhere near ready to commit to that with me.

I believe he’s the one. That I can findly find my happily ever after with him. He’s that great of a guy. We’re not in contact through social media or text even. But we often see each other at social gatherings as our families are friends. We’re both aspiring to be doctors but studying in different colleges sadly. 

I’d be really grateful if you could help me out and give me some advice. 
P.s : In our society if a girl is approaching the guy head on and very strongly. It’s frowned upon by the people and a stigma is usually attached to her character. Help me!!

In need of your help,

We fought , we made up and worked on our selfs, at least that’s what I thought, she had been cheating on me with several people and I didn’t know but like anything else we fought and made up, I forgave her or so I thought but I couldn’t fully trust her anymore, a year went by with constant fights , we thought we loved each other just because we could put up with all the bs we went thru but in reality it was just an excuse. Recently I found out she was on tinder and talking to several people again calling them “baby”, “babe”, “daddy” I confronted her and said she was just talking with them cause I didn’t make her happy and they did. Made me feel like a piece of garbage, because I was giving my all trying to make her happy , take her out , bought her gifts , surprises , yet everything I did didn’t matter. Every single time we argue she turns physical and starts going for my face, I tried breaking up with her , but honestly we just end up fighting , she gets physical and then we talk things out and I’m tired of it, this isn’t a relationship. She lives with me now and I don’t know how to lay he down easy , should I do it in person and deal with the punches and scratches or over the phone to avoid them but then again she’s at my house she could do something......

162,8kdxlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kdxlp/girlfriend_of_2_years_has_steadily_gained_over_80/,Girlfriend of 2 years has steadily gained over 80 pounds of weight with no intention to recognize the weight gain or do anything about it.,"Okay so I [23/m] am a very fit person and HIGHLY value fitness.  I value it so much that I wouldn't even consider dating someone who's even slightly overweight, which comes to my predicament. 
 When I started dating my girlfriend [24/f] she was very thin (which I have now learned she attributes to ""going clubbing every weekend"" and not dieting or intentionally working out) so over the duration of our 2-year relationship she has put on a sizable amount of weight, to the point where I no longer find her attractive.  She keeps gaining weight and won't change anything.


Now, I've tried addressing this issue in a very subtle way repeatedly over the past 2 years (as after about 3 months I noticed her gaining weight), so I suggested date ideas that would get her outside.  Things like hiking, biking, playing tennis, etc. but she gradually started to resent me for suggesting physical activity, and either came up with tons of excuses or outright refused the idea.  I have made comments about how ""I would never date a fat person"" and ""I like fit people"" and the like for a while, but she started resenting me for the implication, which is why I changed to a new strategy, positive reinforcement, where when she does come out and do a physical activity I'm very affectionate and say things like ""I'm proud of you"" but she's so insecure about her own fitness that she's insulted by these comments.  
Since we live together I've taken it upon myself to buy healthier groceries, and suggest meal ideas which aren't so calorie intensive, but in response she purchases things like ice cream and eats a very sizable amount after many dinners. 


Which brings me to this conclusion: I think she realizes what I'm trying to do, and instead of helping me help her, she is very resentful and passive aggressive about it, making conscious effort to do the opposite of what I want.  


If we didn't live together I would break up with her because of this behavior.  Firstly because I'm irritated with her passive aggressive reactions to me encouraging her to being more fit, and secondly because I'm no longer attracted to her.  The latter isn't inherently a deal breaker because I'm committed to this relationship, but it will become a deal breaker very very soon if she doesn't make any effort to change.  I'm incredibly frustrated, and it's interfering with my habits, my work, and schooling in a very negative way.  After her refusal to change, I now play video games whenever we're both home so that I don't have to hang out with her, and I only come to bed after she's already asleep, and while she's asleep I regularly watch porn because I get more enjoyment from that than sex with her.  



Originally I dealt with the situation by getting out of the house as much as possible to work out, hang out with friends, or study on campus, but she started thinking I was seeing someone else, and as a result started having emotional outbursts, was checking through my phone regularly, and when she didn't find anything, she would accuse me of deleting messages.  Which is why I now play video games because now she knows I'm at home not cheating on her, and I don't have to hang out with her or deal with her emotional outbursts. This is affecting my body as well, as I'm not getting the workouts I need to stay fit. And she's been making passive aggressive comments again about me ""playing games all day"" which is frustrating because it doesn't seem like I can address the issue in any healthy way and the relationship will just get worse with anything I do.


We were about to break up, but since we signed a year lease together (which ends in 6 months) I've been taking efforts to rebuild the relationship.  I committed to a month-long trip to Japan with her this summer, and that's giving us some emotional room to curb our resentment towards each other, but the underlying issue is still buried and unaddressed in a healthy way.


I really need help with this situation, and I have no idea what to do.  I tried clearly voicing my interest in fitness.  I tried eating healthier together.  I tried encouraging healthy behavior. I tried positive reinforcement with exercising together.  None of these worked, and only caused her to resent me.  Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.  

tl;dr 
My gf has been gaining weight over the past 2 years, and despite any efforts on my end to encourage a healthier and more active lifestyle, she refuses to change, keeps gaining weight, and builds resentment for me for trying to make her change (even though to me, she was the one that changed since she was incredibly thin when we met.  It's like she catfished me).  I value fitness, and am trapped in a relationship I wouldn't normally be in, and if I don't find a solution soon, I'll have to break up with her after our lease ends in 6 months.

163,8kdxbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kdxbr/bf_getting_out_of_army_for_me_feeling_nervous/,"BF getting out of Army for me, feeling nervous.","My bf (He's 25 and I'm a 29 F) is finally getting out of the army after three years of dating. We're planning on moving in together in the next few months once he's out, but unfortunately the kicker is I am finishing up my masters degree and don't know where I'll be as I'm searching for a job. One worry I have is that he is getting out of the army because of me, while I'm feeling more and more unsure about the relationship. Since he came back from deployment in January we've been having a hard time reconnecting and the distance (we've been long distance for 3 years) has really hit. I'm not so sure if he's the one anymore as I started to realize how different we are once the honeymoon period faded. Plus, we have both changed a lot over the last three years. He's talking about going to law school which is such a departure from his original goals when we met of being in the Army and wanting to do Reconnaissance. 

I was very honest when I told him I couldn't continue to date him if he stayed in the military because that lifestyle is not for me. So he's getting out and looking into law schools and I'm just worried I'm influencing him too much, when I really want him to have his own goals. Is it just my own hang up? I've reiterated to him many times that he needs to figure out if this is really what he wants to do. His parents even sat him down questioning him about his decision to go to law school since all he had ever talked about growing up was he wanted to do the Army (so law school was out of left field for all of us). Although, he always said he didn't want to make a career out of it. Do it for 8 years then go on to something else like a cop or firefighter, but essentially he was never sure what he wanted to do. Except now, he's getting after four years because he met me and would rather start a family with me. No pressure. I will admit, he is one of those people who is go with the flow but can sometimes be easily influenced. Especially with the Army, you have to kind of sip the kool-aid to survive. Not too mention he's a bit naive...like the fact he went into the Army thinking it'd be awesome and its actually a bureaucratic nightmare (color me not surprised). 

I want to try living together and being in the same place to give it a real shot, but I just wish there wasn't so much riding on it. I think that idea has been eating at me our entire relationship. Plus, I'm a slight commit-a-phobe. Additionally, he can be very lazy sometimes, meanwhile I have found my ambition while being in graduate school. I finally know what I want to do and the career path I want to take and I've worked so hard these last three years to do it. I'm very career/goal oriented and my field, marine science, doesn't lend to finding jobs anywhere so I really have to go where the jobs are. He does seem pretty serious about law school though. Been studying like crazy for the LSAT (very disciplined) and wants to go into sports management law because he is obsessed with UFC. He also told me he doesn't want to be poor for the rest of his life and wants to be able to have security to afford the things he wants to do. A part of me thinks he's being a bit naive about law school and isn't aware of the workload, but maybe I'm just being unfair. 

Am I just being too sensitive or overly cautious? Is this maybe just a fear of commitment on my part? Do I need to just believe him? OR am I needlessly stressing because of all the other things going on in my life (i.e. finishing my thesis, lack of job security, etc.)? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated or maybe I should just go see a therapist cause I'm never able to relax about anything. I'm a worrier.

I am 34 and I live with my boyfriend, who I have stayed together for 2 years. I have migraines for once or twice every month, which are usually mild to moderate, lasts no more than 12 hours. 

My migraine attacked yesterday morning on the first day of my menstruation. It was the most terrible attack as far as I remember. The pain was on both temples of my head. I had nausea and vomit. The pain scale is 10/10. I struggled to drove home from work and arrived at 10 pm. My boyfriend had already gone to bed. When I show up at the door, he first comforted me and asked me to take medicine. When I struggled to take my suit off he started to touch me without any request. I said no and he just started to raped me. I don't even have time to take off my suit. I had no power to resist. I was still in the peak of the pain. Sex activity did nothing other than aggravate my pain to the next level.

By the time I woke up today he had already gone to work. My head still hurts terribly now. I missed my work. We have sex almost everyday but I just couldn't do that yesterday. I can merely remember that he said I looks good when massaging myself in migraine once. He also consider me as most pretty when I was in business formal dress which is the exact dress I was wearing last night[(example)](http://www.scarves.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Business_formal_featured_sf_03.jpg). In usual I can simply overpower him since I had some combat training. I don't think he really understand migraine. But he's also a really kind person and we are still in deep love. I just don't know how to talk to him after he returns home today. Any advice?

166,8kdov7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kdov7/21f_my_boyfriend_27m_have_very_different_sex/,[21F] My boyfriend [27M] have very different sex drives and it's causing a lot of strain.,"Hi, everyone, I'm Joan and I like madmen and Joan Holloway! It's nice to have a character you love with the same name as you, haha. Anyway, let's get down to the problem so I don't bore you.

&nbsp;


As the title says, my boyfriend and I have very different sex drives. He wants it when I don't and I didn't initially think this was a problem, but, of course, and understandably, it is for him. Beyond that, what really bothers me is I feel like he tries to guilt me into it and I don't know if I'm just taking things the wrong way or not so I'll try to explain as objectively as possible how these things go.

&nbsp;

He'll say he wants to have sex and  I'll say I'm not in the mood for it. He'll ask me repeatedly sometimes, other times he won't. It doesn't always turn into the following but when it does it goes like this: I'll tell him I don't really feel like it, he'll ask what that means. I either sort of try to explain or I, like most recently, tell him I don't even know what THAT means. He'll continue on and tell me one of the following things or all of these:

&nbsp;


* It's different for men.
* It's hard to be rejected by you.
* I need it to feel loved.
* Why can't you just do it anyway? (This really feels like it conflicts with the previous)

&nbsp;


It can't possibly feel like 'love' when they're trying to coerce you into doing so. I've mentioned that I hate saying no because it feels like he's guilting me and he tells me he's not guilting me; he's just telling me how he feels and I don't know how to respond to that because, at the end of the day, it still makes me feel guilty. 

&nbsp;

He also expressed that when I DO it when I don't feel like it, he doesn't enjoy it because I don't seem happy and I really don't understand what I'm supposed to do about that. It gets so tense - how could it be comfortable to do something when you're doing it because you don't want to argue or ruin the mood? I also don't really feel like, in general, it's fair to have to do something like sex when I don't feel like it. Which is fair but simultaneously, I don't feel like it's fair to be denied something like that, either. I guess. I don't know. 

&nbsp;

I didn't actually know how old she was until a couple of weeks ago (never bothered to ask before) though she's known how old I am for a while longer.
Usually her and I talking consists of me giving her advice about dealing with people in high school or her brothers or now ex boyfriend, but since her and said boyfriend broke up she's become increasingly attached if that makes sense. She wants to be talking more often, voice chatting whenever I can or something. Since her and her boyfriend broke up things have felt weird when talking to her, like she suddenly got more relaxed or personal about everything.
To make things worse a week ago I had said to a male friend of mine that I loved him during a voice call and she questioned me about it. I explained that all my close friends I would say that I love, and she asked later on if I considered her a close friend.
I said yes, not thinking about the earlier conversation, but since then she's been saying ""I love ya"" or something similar each night whenever she goes to bed.
Now I'm not 100% sure that she has a crush on me, but I want to avoid it as much as possible. I'm 18, and she's 16, there's no world where that ends well.
I still want to be friends with her, she isn't a bad person by any means, but I don't want things to get weird and I don't want anyone on her end seeing her talking to me and thinking there's something bad going on.
TL;DR - She's young and showing signs of developing feelings for me, I don't want to end the friendship but I don't want anything like that to start in her mind.

Sex was meh, I'm not attracted to her at all but it felt nice to feel wanted.

Made the mistake of going back for seconds. Feeling wanted felt so good.

Well we've now been ""dating"" for about 9 months and she's talking about Marriage before I go into the Air Force. I don't want to do this, and I tried to break it off before this, but she threatened suicide to me. She does, in fact, have a bad history with Suicide attempts and crippling anxiety that I learned about 6 months in (and mind you, the anxiety is so bad that we were driving through Atlanta on time and she almost killed us because a Semi was riding our ass so she opted to drive on the fucking shoulder going 70 until she found a way in).

When I attempted to break up with her, she told me that I'm all she has and that if I were to leave she would attempt suicide. Now, I could simply call on the proper people to stop her from doing so but I have zero doubts that she wouldn't do it before they got there.

I can't imagine myself living with her as my wife. Sex and intimacy make me uncomfortable. Her breath smells like sardines at all times, and she has PCOS which has made her infertile (I want kids in a marriage and she cannot provide that).

I was in a mentally abusive relationship, and regardless of whether or not I liked another girl, the relationship would have ended anyway. I told my ex about my interest in this other girl (18F), I wouldn’t lie to her about it. She was disappointed obviously, but she was glad that I didn’t lie to her about it. Me liking the other girl only sped up the process of our breakup.

I had been leaning on the girl I liked for advice about my relationship since it became toxic, and she asked why she was being ignored by my ex, who had left the friend group without saying a word (while we were still dating). It wouldnt make sense to her unless I told her.. so I did. I told her I liked her and that I had a crush on her for a while, to which she responded with similar feelings for me. We were both shocked, to say the least. I broke up with her two days after this happened.

It’s been a week since I broke up with my ex, and me and the girl I’m interested in hung out for the first time yesterday. I guess you could say we went on a date, and then we went back to my house and you could tell that we struggled to talk to each other because, we both didn’t know what to do.

To be honest, I want to wait as long as I can before getting in another relationship so soon after my breakup.

I looked at her and said “Hey man, that’s my tank top you’re wearing.” To which she replied “No. This is my tank top, I bought it my Freshman year and such and such party so I could show my tiddies to boys.” To which I said “Well then I guess we must have the SAME EXACT tank top cause I’ve been wearing it to bed all semester.” And she retorted “Yeah I guess so.”

Now if you couldn’t gather she was also really drunk when this went down and while I don’t actually have great emotional attachment to said red tank top I want it the fuck back, it’s about principle, she’s dishonored me and my family God damn it. Drunk and angry me last night told myself that I was welcome to something in her closet if she was gonna keep my clothes as her own but my now hungover brain is just telling me to ask her again or just steal it back when she stops wearing it. I’m not tryna beef man I just want my shit back. What’s my best option here? Oh and as a side note this girl is EXTREMELY volatile when she’s drunk (and she’s a midwestern sorority girl so she’s drunk about 20 hours of the day), I’ve seen her get in fights with people minding their own damn business, it’s honestly like a superpower.

183,8kc6mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kc6mh/i_found_out_some_stuff_about_a_friends_girlfriend/,I found out some stuff about a friend's girlfriend I wish I didn't and don't know if I should approach her about it.,"This is a longish story so sorry and strap in.

I'll start off by saying that my friend ( more like a brother, we're extremely close and have known each other our whole lives) and his girlfriend have been in a relationship for around 8 years now, they have a son but he's from a previous relationship.

This whole mess started around a year ago when they had quite an abrupt split ( they're actually together again now and better than ever) and whilst I was yoyoing between them both to make sure they were ok I had a few drinks one night with my friends girlfriend and the subject changed to sex ( she's quite promiscuous). I thought now that they aren't together I can be honest and explain the reason why I'm single and I don't introduce her to women I see ( which she's fascinated about but I didn't think it appropriate for her or my friend to know whilst they were together) was because I have a very.... specific relationship dynamic with women. BDSM to be honest. Not all the time but when I can. She wasn't very surprised because I always gave off that ""vibe"" according to her. She then proceeded to tell me that she *used* to be into it and went into great detail about her past. Now here comes the problem...I already knew. I don't think she realises how connected the community is where we live and that I'm about 90% sure I have been to parties she's been to and seen her do stuff. That means naked and performing sexual/non sexual acts. That's something I've had to carry on my mind but it doesn't really matter right? It's in the past and for all I know my friend is into it too. The problem is, no, he isn't and she told me this. I know how much of a problem this can be because most people in the scene generally don't get any sexual satisfaction from"" vanilla"" sex. This is obviously a huge problem in a relationship as sex and intimacy are important.

Now this leads me to my next part. I got back in touch with a girl I knew a few years back and she was back in town and I thought it would be cool to introduce her to my friends girlfriend as she's into the same stuff and I thought they would get on really well. It turns out my friend already knew her, not in person but immediately recognised her from a photo I showed. She then did some snooping and found that the reason she recognised her was because she was being followed by her on a social media website ( which I won't name). My friend then gave me her handle and said I should read and look at some of the stuff she's into and done and that I'd be surprised. Turns out she was 100% right. Most of it is irrelevant because the past is the past but a few things have stuck in my throat a lot. The first is that she broke a golden rule that you *never* use your picture in your profile unless you're concealing parts of your body that makes you easily distinguishable. She didn't even fucking try. It's clear as day her. This could cause *massive* problems, if her work found out she would almost certainly be sacked and if her friends found out her son would undoubtedly be mocked or worse none of his friends parents would allow their children to go on playdates with him let sound her getting mocked for it. The second golden rule she broke was that she uses the same username handle on *every* BDSM related sites she uses. This makes it even easier to find sensitive information she should have tried a lot harder at concealing. I'm honestly annoyed at how naive she has been about it but then question whether it's even naivity but instead narcissism and she enjoys everyone knowing.

Now here are the big problems.

One of the websites is active as of a year ago. It's specifically for something non sexual related but I've been in the scene for nearing 10 years now to know that it nearly always becomes sexual. Apparently my friend knows about it ( according to the profile) and that he's fine about it. The problem is the profile was recently updated with a BDSM test result that most people take and leave on their profile so that people can easily match with others with similar interests. One of the scores, non monogamy, was in the high 90%. This is a problem because I know what the questions are like ( very detailed) that outline monogamy and if you're scoring that high you're 100% saying yes to questions about allowing infidelity, orgies etc. This completely contradicts the part where it's meant to be strictly non sexual. Now, the very specific thing she's into nearly always turns out sexual. I've had many women claim the exact same thing and after a couple of times doing it it becomes sexually charged very easily. The problem I have is that if my friend isn't able to offer that part of the relationship she's going to go see other people, gain an emotional attachment and then have an emotional affair which eventually results in her having sex. I've seen this happen dozens, upon dozens of times. The massive risk is always there.

This leads me to the last thing I found and the worst by far. Without going into detail I found a few erotic stories she had written which described her having sex with her dog ie beastiality. I can tell it was her because of the username, the description of her appearance, age and very clear writing style etc ( again why would you even divulge that information? People don't need to know how you look?) Now, these could be erotic fiction but she stated, many times, that they were true events. The detail, in all honestly, sickened me. I'm not in the habit of shaming people but this is where I draw a clear line. It's fucked up. 

This made me think about all the other things she's into ( things that a lot of people would think is fucked up to enjoy), sexual and non sexual and I'm starting to see the bigger picture that she is *very* into anything extremely taboo and going off my previous experience if you don't draw lines and make rules things end up nasty. If you can't explore these things with your partner it's going to end up badly. I now think about how they are together a lot and notice things I didn't before. My friend always initiates intimacy, I can see love in his eyes. With her I never see that but instead get a sense of her seeing him as her best friend and not love. She always talks about women, I'm starting to think she isn't even attracted to men as much as she should be if she's willing to be in a relationship with one. I'm thinking that the only reason they settled their differences and got back together is because her life would have been crap without him. She'd have to move, explain why dad isn't in her son's life anymore and that he isn't his real dad and that his real one didn't want him, she'd be financially *way* worse off and all of their friends are actually our friends as she doesn't really have any, or I haven't met any in all these years. My friends life trajectory is limitless and he'd undoubtedly bounce back where as she'd only go backwards. It's harsh to say but true and I think she realised this. Now I'm afraid this is going to lead to no where and my friend is being strung along and unintentionally used.

So... That's it I guess. I'm not sure if I should approach any of them about this. I could really do with some advice. I'm really anxious for them all the time.","['find', 'stuff', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'wish', 'know', 'approach', 'longish', 'story', 'sorry', 'strap', 'start', 'say', 'friend', 'like', 'brother', 'extremely', 'close', 'know', 'live', 'girlfriend', 'relationship', '8', 'year', 'son', 'previous', 'relationship', 'mess', 'start', 'year', 'ago', 'abrupt', 'split', 'actually', 'well', 'whilst', 'yoyoe', 'sure', 'ok', 'drink', 'night', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'subject', 'change', 'sex', 'promiscuous', 'think', 'honest', 'explain', 'reason', 'single', 'introduce', 'woman', 'fascinated', 'think', 'appropriate', 'friend', 'know', 'whilst', 'specific', 'relationship', 'dynamic', 'woman', 'bdsm', 'honest', 'time', 'surprised', 'give', 'vibe', 'accord', 'proceed', 'tell', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'past', 'come', 'problem', 'know', 'think', 'realise', 'connected', 'community', 'live', '90', 'sure', 'party', 'see', 'stuff', 'mean', 'naked', 'perform', 'sexual', 'non', 'sexual', 'act', 'carry', 'mind', 'matter', 'right', 'past', 'know', 'friend', 'problem', 'tell', 'know', 'problem', 'people', 'scene', 'generally', 'sexual', 'satisfaction', 'vanilla', 'sex', 'obviously', 'huge', 'problem', 'relationship', 'sex', 'intimacy', 'important', 'lead', 'get', 'touch', 'girl', 'know', 'year', 'town', 'think', 'cool', 'introduce', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'stuff', 'think', 'turn', 'friend', 'know', 'person', 'immediately', 'recognise', 'photo', 'show', 'snoop', 'find', 'reason', 'recognise', 'follow', 'social', 'medium', 'website', 'friend', 'give', 'handle', 'say', 'read', 'look', 'stuff', 'surprised', 'turn', '100', 'right', 'irrelevant', 'past', 'past', 'thing', 'stick', 'throat', 'lot', 'break', 'golden', 'rule', 'use', 'picture', 'profile', 'conceal', 'part', 'body', 'make', 'easily', 'distinguishable', 'fucking', 'try', 'clear', 'day', 'cause', 'massive', 'problem', 'work', 'find', 'certainly', 'sack', 'friend', 'find', 'son', 'undoubtedly', 'mock', 'bad', 'friend', 'parent', 'allow', 'child', 'playdate', 'let', 'sound', 'get', 'mock', 'second', 'golden', 'rule', 'break', 'use', 'username', 'handle', 'bdsm', 'related', 'site', 'use', 'make', 'easy', 'find', 'sensitive', 'information', 'try', 'lot', 'hard', 'conceal', 'honestly', 'annoy', 'naive', 'question', 'naivity', 'instead', 'narcissism', 'enjoy', 'know', 'big', 'problem', 'website', 'active', 'year', 'ago', 'specifically', 'non', 'sexual', 'related', 'scene', 'near', '10', 'year', 'know', 'nearly', 'sexual', 'apparently', 'friend', 'know', 'accord', 'profile', 'fine', 'problem', 'profile', 'recently', 'update', 'bdsm', 'test', 'result', 'people', 'leave', 'profile', 'people', 'easily', 'match', 'similar', 'interest', 'score', 'non', 'monogamy', 'high', '90', 'problem', 'know', 'question', 'like', 'detailed', 'outline', 'monogamy', 'score', 'high', '100', 'say', 'yes', 'question', 'allow', 'infidelity', 'orgy', 'etc', 'completely', 'contradict', 'mean', 'strictly', 'non', 'sexual', 'specific', 'thing', 'nearly', 'turn', 'sexual', 'woman', 'claim', 'exact', 'thing', 'couple', 'time', 'sexually', 'charge', 'easily', 'problem', 'friend', 'able', 'offer', 'relationship', 'go', 'people', 'gain', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'emotional', 'affair', 'eventually', 'result', 'have', 'sex', 'see', 'happen', 'dozen', 'dozen', 'time', 'massive', 'risk', 'lead', 'thing', 'find', 'bad', 'far', 'go', 'detail', 'find', 'erotic', 'story', 'write', 'describe', 'have', 'sex', 'dog', 'ie', 'beastiality', 'tell', 'username', 'description', 'appearance', 'age', 'clear', 'writing', 'style', 'etc', 'divulge', 'information', 'people', 'need', 'know', 'look', 'erotic', 'fiction', 'state', 'time', 'true', 'event', 'detail', 'honestly', 'sicken', 'habit', 'shame', 'people', 'draw', 'clear', 'line', 'fuck', 'think', 'thing', 'thing', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'fuck', 'enjoy', 'sexual', 'non', 'sexual', 'start', 'big', 'picture', 'extremely', 'taboo', 'go', 'previous', 'experience', 'draw', 'line', 'rule', 'thing', 'end', 'nasty', 'explore', 'thing', 'partner', 'go', 'end', 'badly', 'think', 'lot', 'notice', 'thing', 'friend', 'initiate', 'intimacy', 'love', 'eye', 'instead', 'sense', 'see', 'good', 'friend', 'love', 'talk', 'woman', 'start', 'think', 'attract', 'man', 'willing', 'relationship', 'think', 'reason', 'settle', 'difference', 'get', 'life', 'crap', 'explain', 'dad', 'son', 'life', 'anymore', 'real', 'dad', 'real', 'want', 'financially', 'way', 'bad', 'friend', 'actually', 'friend', 'meet', 'year', 'friend', 'life', 'trajectory', 'limitless', 'undoubtedly', 'bounce', 'backwards', 'harsh', 'true', 'think', 'realise', 'afraid', 'go', 'lead', 'friend', 'string', 'unintentionally', 'guess', 'sure', 'approach', 'advice', 'anxious', 'time']"

[f20]","Hello reddit, so where to begin? Well I have been with my boyfriend[m21]. I seem to be very infatuated about blossoming the relationship and over coming our obstacles, but with each passing month it’s become apparent that this will never happen. I surely have a very optimistic mind but him on the other hand... I’ve never had a solid relationship with anyone due to them either cheating on me or flat out not caring. I was always good to every person that I dated, no problem or confrontation with me ever happened. I guess I just gravitate towards lowlifes. With that being said I really had no respect for men you can even say I loathed them and I question why they were like this. But I still yearned for a beautiful relationship with someone that I can be comfortable around and experience things. So with the boyfriend I am currently with we started off very rocky. He was so persistent to know about my past and who I associated with. At the time I met him I was cutting ties with a so called “fling”. Someone who was very infatuated with me but I did not feel the same. Communication with him dwindled but was still there. The way that my boyfriend came off I was scared to tell him the truth and gave him a white lie saying that he was just a family friend and he didn’t need to worry about it. I cut ties with him knowing that the relationship with my boyfriend was going to be more. I knew that I wanted to be with him so I just didn’t want him to worry. Was that so wrong of me to do. I currently have a problem telling my boyfriend the truth when it comes to the past even when it comes to little stuff but it’s tarnished our relationship to the point where he resents me and does not trust me what so ever. It leads us to have a really toxic relationship and we recently got into a fight and he stated that it took 10 months to see that he couldn’t change me. It hurt because I feel like I have a sort of insecurity and reasoning to lie to him. I have more stories but I wanted to keep this short. If you would like to know more please ask.

I, M19, have started talking to a F19 recently. Before we even had our first date, I was informed by some of her friends that she had an interest in me. Our first date went very smoothly and her friends informed me once again that she strongly enjoyed me, but that she didn’t think I felt the same way about her. Now, I personally think she is very much my type and I really do enjoy her. We are going out Sunday evening and I would like to subtly push it across the board that I feel similarly about her as she does to me. However, I am afraid of coming on too strongly. Therefore, I’d like to know, how can I accomplish this without sounding pushy? Are a few subtle compliments here and there fine, or is that too much? What can I do to make this girl get the vibe that yes, I feel about her as she feels about me?","['vibe', 'm19', 'likeness', 'girl', 'f19', 'hello', 'm19', 'start', 'talk', 'f19', 'recently', 'date', 'inform', 'friend', 'interest', 'date', 'go', 'smoothly', 'friend', 'inform', 'strongly', 'enjoy', 'think', 'feel', 'way', 'personally', 'think', 'type', 'enjoy', 'go', 'sunday', 'evening', 'like', 'subtly', 'push', 'board', 'feel', 'similarly', 'afraid', 'come', 'strongly', 'like', 'know', 'accomplish', 'sound', 'pushy', 'subtle', 'compliment', 'fine', 'girl', 'vibe', 'yes', 'feel', 'feel']"

It's been a bit more than one year we're together now and she's become more aggressive than usual, making rude remarks about anything that she doesn't agree with and turning any conversation into an argument, trying to prove me wrong all the time and giving me the silence treatment every time she can't do that. I've tried to talk with her about those specific issues, but every time I do it has the same ending: me apologizing, she saying that she will change or that she doesn't see anything wrong with what she did, and nothing really changing.

Most of the time we've been together it's been a long distance-ish relationship. I am Brazilian, she is American, we met in Russia and lived there and in Moldova for a while (now I'm back in Russia and she's still in Moldova). The peak of the arguments was when she ended the relationship on the beginning of January, saying some pretty offensive things, complaining about how she never felt loved and how I was incapable of showing my feelings. Two weeks later she came back saying that she had made a mistake and she didn't mean the things she'd said and asked to get back together. 

I didn't want that at first because I suspected she was doing that and being all mushy-mushy because none of her friends were around, she had a health problem and her father in the US was also undergoing through surgery. After a lot of asking and promises that things would be different I accepted, and things were indeed different for a while.

After this second honeymoon period she fell back to the old habits and became more distant and since then we've been having at least one argument per week because of the dumbest things ever and that's wearing me off more and more. She picked up the habit of making fun of me to her friends either when I'm not around or when we're in a call and use the ""argument"" that if someone laughed it wasn't offensive and that I am too sensitive. 

The ""if I was the one saying that you wouldn't like it as well"" approach is ineffective and she has already stated multiple times that she has no empathy. Every time we disagree on something she vanishes for a while (making a poll with her friends I suspect) and quits saying ""I love you"" or anything caring for that matter for days in a row.

I can't make her understand how some of the things she says and does are damaging to our relationship and on her point of view everything is a matter of being right or wrong, she never (and this is not an exaggeration) wants to discuss her feelings or wishes, but rather just keep silent.

Recently she's also made this new friend [M/?] whose first information volunteered to me was that he ""is super gay"". He has already stayed at her place twice, each staying being of 3 days long, and today he's supposed to go again (travel from another different city to hers). 

I don't really think she's cheating on me, but I don't feel comfortable with the situation anyways (and don't really put the possibility aside), maybe I would if we could have any kind of emotional connection the way we had before. I feel like I can't trust her with my feelings and more and more that trust is affecting how much I trust her as a person and care about our relationship.

It came to the point where she has a trip planned to my city in the next few weeks and I'm not even sure I want her to come anymore. Our last fight was yesterday and was followed by the most awkward call ever between a couple, I think I've had more intimate calls to customer service than that.

TL;DR She (girlfriend) says that she loves me and wants to stay with me but at the same time she doesn't seem to care at all, and also seem completely oblivious to the fact that she doesn't seem to care - if that makes any sense.

The last thing I want is to break up, but don't know how to trust any meaningful discussion to her without it becoming a debate.","['26', 'm', 'feel', 'like', 'emotionally', 'trust', '23', 'f', 'girlfriend', 'bit', 'year', 'aggressive', 'usual', 'make', 'rude', 'remark', 'agree', 'turn', 'conversation', 'argument', 'try', 'prove', 'wrong', 'time', 'give', 'silence', 'treatment', 'time', 'try', 'talk', 'specific', 'issue', 'time', 'ending', 'apologize', 'say', 'change', 'wrong', 'change', 'time', 'long', 'distance', 'ish', 'relationship', 'brazilian', 'american', 'meet', 'russia', 'live', 'moldova', 'russia', 'moldova', 'peak', 'argument', 'end', 'relationship', 'beginning', 'january', 'say', 'pretty', 'offensive', 'thing', 'complain', 'feel', 'love', 'incapable', 'show', 'feeling', 'week', 'later', 'come', 'say', 'mistake', 'mean', 'thing', 'say', 'ask', 'want', 'suspect', 'mushy', 'mushy', 'friend', 'health', 'problem', 'father', 'undergo', 'surgery', 'lot', 'ask', 'promise', 'thing', 'different', 'accept', 'thing', 'different', 'second', 'honeymoon', 'period', 'fall', 'old', 'habit', 'distant', 'have', 'argument', 'week', 'dumb', 'thing', 'wear', 'pick', 'habit', 'make', 'fun', 'friend', 'use', 'argument', 'laugh', 'offensive', 'sensitive', 'say', 'like', 'approach', 'ineffective', 'state', 'multiple', 'time', 'empathy', 'time', 'disagree', 'vanish', 'make', 'poll', 'friend', 'suspect', 'quit', 'say', 'love', 'care', 'matter', 'day', 'row', 'understand', 'thing', 'say', 'damage', 'relationship', 'point', 'view', 'matter', 'right', 'wrong', 'exaggeration', 'want', 'discuss', 'feeling', 'wish', 'silent', 'recently', 'new', 'friend', 'm/', 'information', 'volunteer', 'super', 'gay', 'stay', 'place', 'twice', 'staying', '3', 'day', 'long', 'today', 'suppose', 'travel', 'different', 'city', 'think', 'cheat', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'situation', 'anyway', 'possibility', 'aside', 'maybe', 'kind', 'emotional', 'connection', 'way', 'feel', 'like', 'trust', 'feeling', 'trust', 'affect', 'trust', 'person', 'care', 'relationship', 'come', 'point', 'trip', 'plan', 'city', 'week', 'sure', 'want', 'come', 'anymore', 'fight', 'yesterday', 'follow', 'awkward', 'couple', 'think', 'intimate', 'call', 'customer', 'service', 'tl;dr', 'girlfriend', 'say', 'love', 'want', 'stay', 'time', 'care', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'care', 'make', 'sense', 'thing', 'want', 'break', 'know', 'trust', 'meaningful', 'discussion', 'debate']"

Last time I visited was in February, because I was catching a flight and had some spare time. My bff and I have been trying to plan a weekend together since then to no avail, but a couple weeks ago her boyfriend(19m) offered to plan a road trip for them to come pick me up in my town, and bring me down for the long weekend. 

The problem my SO has with this is her boyfriend, who had a crush on me almost 2 years ago. He doesn't seem to understand that when this guy had a thing for me, I wasn't interested, and I've told him all the things that happened between him and I. (we went to a carnival with a group of friends and he was my ""date"" then he slept over at my place, on the couch, and the next morning we sat and watched cartoons together) Also another thing is this guy is dating my BESTFRIEND. I practically set them up. 

I told my bf a couple weeks ago that they had offered to come get me, and that I was considering it. He got very upset and said things like ""oh you'd LOOOOVE that, spending 5 hours in a car with him???"" It really hurt my feelings and I couldnt get a word in. I didn't bring it up but I didn't decline the offer, because I wasn't sure if I should go against how he feels. 

Today I told him I decided I'm going, because I want to see my family, and go shopping, and I think I deserve it, and all asked was ""whose picking you up"" I told him it was still my previous plan and now he hasn't talked to me all evening. I gave him some space and I thought about it more and later I walked up to him and rubbed his back and he got mad at me and said ""don't touch me!!!"" So he's clearly very upset. 

What do I do? I don't want to cancel but I don't want him to be upset. I'm stressed about it and it's unfair.

This is a serious career move for her and I wanna be supportive and I wanna be with this person... but I feel like the relationship will eventually take a toll.

She wants to be with me, but has clearly stated that her career comes first, and if I cant take that, then the relationship probably wont work. I agree with her. Of course, I want her to be happy and follow her dreams. I do not blame her or feel resentful towards her. I just don't know if I can handle being in a relationship without really being in one. I feel like I might be able to do it for a bit but will eventually break... am I being selfish? I dont wanna lose this person but it almost feels like I already lost her.

197,8kajnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kajnf/21f_want_to_try_to_work_things_out_with_my/,(21F) Want to try to work things out with my boyfriend of a year (20M) but not sure how to or if it's worth it. Help!,"To give some context: We've been going out for a year, and throughout the relationship, my boyfriend has been dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression. Having had bouts of both anxiety and depression in the past, I was able to help him initially seek therapy because these problems were weighing on him (and on our relationship). After we had a really healthy discussion about mental health and he started going to therapy, and things seemed to be getting better. However, around 4 months ago there was a shift in our relationship, and I'm not exactly sure why. I also don't know if both of us felt this shift, or it was just me. We just weren't really communicating and bickering all the time. I began almost to dislike him, and I lost a lot of respect for him (which is really hard to admit and breaks my heart to say). 

I've found that we don't share a lot of the same values especially when it comes to how we live our lives. I have dealt with and overcome mental health issues since I was in middle school, and I highly prioritize self-care and protecting my wellbeing (by living in a way that strengthens my mental health vs. worsens it). However, he is still struggling with behaviours that seem make his mental health worse. He always tells me how he wants to start changing and focusing on his wellbeing like doing meditation or starting to cook (versus not eating) but never follows through. I don't need him to make these promises to me nor do I ask him to, because in the end it's his life and he has to decide what he needs to do. But it's frustrating when he continually makes promises to himself and tells me, but does not end up working on it. Instead, he ends up projecting his anxiety and insecurity onto the relationship and onto me, which makes it even harder for me to deal with. 

But the other side of him is loving and incredibly giving. We usually have a good time together, but these issues do come up, and every time they do it becomes harder and harder for me to deal with. It's taking me a long time to realize this, in part because I hate having a problem with how my boyfriend is dealing with HIS mental health. Mental health issues are such a struggle and I hate not being caring and supportive all the time, letting this get to me.  But it really does affect me, and I honestly get to the point where I am toxic towards him. Like I will be overly critical or shutdown my own emotions. To that extent, I know that a major part of the issues I'm feeling have to do with me. I can be selfish and I get disappointed in him (sometimes unfairly). At this point, I'm really indecisive on whether to break up with him or keep working but I want to try and talk it out and tell him what I've been feeling. 

In these past 4 months, I have begun not to explain how I feel, rather I just shut down and grown more resentful. This is horrible and unfair to him. And I want to explain to him, why I do it and how I am trying to change, but I don't know how to approach that. Also, I don't necessarily know how I can fix myself and change my behaviours. So any advice on how I can become a better person in this relationship or advice on how to open up about these feelings to my boyfriend would be helpful.

I'm just going to cherry pick something recent which seemed odd at the time: we went to see Deadpool 2 and, when we were leaving, he mentions that he prefers non-aisle seats (I picked aisle seats while he went to the bathroom, but offered to move if he strongly preferred something else), because there's less people having to walk in front of you. I mention I actually prefer aisle seats. He asks me why, but I didn't have an immediate answer, so I say ""just because"". I hadn't given it much thought and that was the best I had at the time. But he persists, why, but why, why do you like the aisle seats? Eventually I mention they're just easier for me to get into, which I like. His response is along the lines of ""see, that's an answer"".

I guess I'm wondering if this is making mountains out of molehills, but it seems like this is a thing he often does. He'll ask me about something I may not have given a lot of consideration, I give an immediate response, which is not good enough for some reason. It feels like I can't answer conversationally, because there's going to be a quiz I'm not allowed to fail. It feels like I have to answer his way or not have an opinion at all, but that seems too harsh. It's just things like that that put me in a bad mood and have me questioning what actually just happened.

---

Then there's other things. To cherry pick another recent example: it starts with me suggesting we play some video games, him declining, then him questioning why I'm not playing without him. I don't really have a good answer to that, because I suppose I could play without him, but I just mention he didn't want to play so I didn't feel like playing. He points out that he was feeling tired so of course he's not playing, but why aren't I playing? Didn't I want to play? And it's another thing that seems to go on and on for way too long, without a clear purpose. I came away feeling like playing a game without him was the only correct response.

----

Like I said, it's a weird sort of distrust, I guess. Somewhat innocuous conversations have taken on an oddly sinister tone, beyond what random conversations about seating and leisure activity decisions seem worthy of. Is it all in my head?

Yes I did wrong but at the end of the day I still wanted to be with you not this girl. Everyone knows I should be with you and not her but we can't be together so I'm forced to move on. I think about you everyday, I can't sleep some nights because i miss you guys & it just sucks. I miss my family. If you could see how crazy I was going not having you anymore everyone kept telling me to get over you so I did. I've never been so crazy for a girl I mean come on I was stalking your house and everything... He hugs me tight & long, says I need someone to talk to I know if I say these things to her she won't understand and gets her feelings hurt. I miss that about you, you weren't so emotional about things like she is... I've tried to break up with her but she tries hurting herself & going really crazy. She rips clothes up broke my phone, beats my ass... as soon as he's out of my sight he cold all over again... He says it's cause she goes through his phone so he rather not bother upsetting her...

But After saying all that negative stuff he quickly says but she's a great girl... she's nice there's just some things im starting to see about her... She won't let me come see you my babymama but she writing a man in jail cause she loves his kids... 
Again he says 
I'm sorry please forgive me, hugs me tightly and continues telling me all the things he's going through in his new relationship. 

I'm at the phase where I still love him some what but I'm strong enough to just listen to what he has to say & even give him advice for his new relationship. He hurt me so badly & now he wants to apologize be friends like I've been asking from the beginning.... sweep all of it under the rug. Which is fine but I hope he knows I'll never forget any of it. 

Anyways now he doesn't have a phone so his 
 girlfriend uses that as a way to control how much he comes to see us. He started standing up for himself saying he shouldnt have to depend on her to see his child...Crazy after he said all this stuff about her it seems like she became more possessive, she comes to visitation with him, makes him check in, she texts me regarding our child. She wants control of everything I guess. She even texted me today about paying child support for him she said she wants everyone to be a big happy family... But in my opinion I think she's trying to manipulate us both so she has control over the situation. She can watch her man & keep me in check so he won't use me as a crutch to talk about her too

What does this guy want I blocked him because he wouldn't come around but as soon as I do he's bringing me money, trying to be a good daddy, finally apologizing to me for breaking my heart etc..

When we are all together I can tell he wants to talk with me so bad, I see him looking at me alot. But we don't say much to eachother because of her... He wants to hug me before he leaves but of course that's only when we meet without her around. I think she pep talks him because they came over and he was mostly with me and the next time he stayed far away from me

Let me give you a little background on my current relationship. I am a senior in high school and my girlfriends is a junior. We have been dating since October and have been officially together for about 5 months. In the beginning it was great. We go to the same school right now which is great so I see her everyday and we would hang out once a week on the weekend not including an extracurricular that we had together most week nights. But fast forward to now I’m just not feeling the same. The first thing is that she’s really busy so once our extracurricular ended I pretty much never saw her during the week. But we both have busy schedules so it is what it is. But the thing is I feel like want to see her more than she wants to see me. I’m always the once asking if she’s free to hangout or go get food or whatever and the only time she ever invites me to anything is if her friends/family prompt her to, which has happened a total of three times in the five months we’ve been dating. Never even so much as a “hey wanna come over” or anything. I just feel like she would rather do other things than spend time with me. We hang out once a week which was fine at first but now I want it to be more. But she is out with her friends all the time so it doesn’t make sense to me. On top of this, even when we’re at school(we go to a really small school) we don’t really see each other more than a couple times a day for maybe a minute or so total. I just feel like I’m not a part of her life anymore. I feel like I never know what’s going on in her life and she’s always out and about. It’s almost like we’re back in that initial dating stage that we were in back in October when we didn’t really talk to each other that much.

It’s honestly makes me feel really sad. I just worry about our relationship constantly. It is always on my mind. I wake up in the morning so depressed and it takes a few hours for me to feel normal again because the weight of this relationship is so heavy. I just feel like my girlfriend should ask to see me sometimes and maybe not make me always do it.

Along with this, I’m going to college two hours away in August. At the beginning of the relationship I would have maybe considered long distance but now I feel like there’s no way it would work. She isn’t someone who I even feel connected with now when we go to the same school so I feel like a LDR would just be awful.

Something else I should mention is that even when we have our one date a week, I don’t feel amazing being with her. She is my first girlfriend so I felt amazing being with her in the beginning but now I don’t. I’m beginning to think that the initial feeling was just the newness of it. Now when we’re together it doesn’t feel that great. We both are religious but she is very religious so we have not done anything physical past kissing/cuddling. She isn’t a big talker and neither am I so sometimes our time together can feel stale.

There are something’s that I really like about her. She’s really really smart and a good person. I love her family a lot and her parents are amazing. And my parents love her and her family as well. Also I trust her more than I’ve ever trusted any other female before and if we were LDR I would have no concerns about her for a trust standpoint. Also, she is constantly texting me about things and all that stuff that she’s always done in the relationship so that’s been pretty constant in the relationship this whole time and when I see her she is usually excited and hugs me or grabs my hand or whatever so I don’t think she’s lost interest in me.

Despite the good, I just feel off in this relationship. I want to talk to her about this but I don’t know how to do it without sounding weak and needy. I don’t want to say “Hey I want to spent more time with you” or “hey how come you spend so much more time with your friends than with me?” Or even telling her that I’m unhappy with the current state of our relationship. I don’t know how to have those types of conversations with her while also not sounding needy and unattractive. I don’t even know if those convos are worth or would work. Shouldn’t my girlfriend already want to spend more time with me/ be more involved if she really likes me that much? But I’ve never been through something like this before so maybe a conversation would work. And I know that I shouldn’t expect her to read my mind but why isn’t she trying to move the relationship along and see me more often? I just don’t understand why I have to question her. To reiterate we both are pretty busy on the weekdays but we both have times that we aren’t busy and it just seems like I do all the work to try and make those times work and she doesn’t. She’s kind of a shy girl so that could be why she doesn’t make attempts at things but she’s always with her friends hanging with them and that doesn’t seem to be a challenge for her. Ultimately I’m wondering if I should try and wait it out and see if it gets better or talk to her about(although I’m unsure about that option) or just break it off with her and move on. Is it supposed to be like this? Thanks.

tl;dr: my girlfriend and I don’t spend a lot of time together and I feel that she doesn’t do her part to see me more often. Also I leave for college in a few months and I’m not sure that I to do an LDR because I don’t think I’d be happy with her. Not sure if this is something to bring up or if it’s just how it is and I need to end things.","['18_m', 'try', 'decide', 'break', 'girlfriend', '17_f', 'hello', 'let', 'little', 'background', 'current', 'relationship', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'junior', 'date', 'october', 'officially', '5', 'month', 'beginning', 'great', 'school', 'right', 'great', 'everyday', 'hang', 'week', 'weekend', 'include', 'extracurricular', 'week', 'night', 'fast', 'forward', 'feel', 'thing', 'busy', 'extracurricular', 'end', 'pretty', 'see', 'week', 'busy', 'schedule', 'thing', 'feel', 'like', 'want', 'want', 'ask', 'free', 'hangout', 'food', 'time', 'invite', 'friend', 'family', 'prompt', 'happen', 'total', 'time', 'month', 'date', 'hey', 'wanna', 'come', 'feel', 'like', 'thing', 'spend', 'time', 'hang', 'week', 'fine', 'want', 'friend', 'time', 'sense', 'school', 'small', 'school', 'couple', 'time', 'day', 'maybe', 'minute', 'total', 'feel', 'like', 'life', 'anymore', 'feel', 'like', 'know', 'go', 'life', 'like', 'initial', 'date', 'stage', 'october', 'talk', 'honestly', 'make', 'feel', 'sad', 'worry', 'relationship', 'constantly', 'mind', 'wake', 'morning', 'depressed', 'take', 'hour', 'feel', 'normal', 'weight', 'relationship', 'heavy', 'feel', 'like', 'girlfriend', 'ask', 'maybe', 'go', 'college', 'hour', 'away', 'august', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'maybe', 'consider', 'long', 'distance', 'feel', 'like', 'way', 'work', 'feel', 'connected', 'school', 'feel', 'like', 'ldr', 'awful', 'mention', 'date', 'week', 'feel', 'amazing', 'girlfriend', 'feel', 'amazing', 'beginning', 'begin', 'think', 'initial', 'feeling', 'newness', 'feel', 'great', 'religious', 'religious', 'physical', 'past', 'kissing', 'cuddle', 'big', 'talker', 'time', 'feel', 'stale', 'like', 'smart', 'good', 'person', 'love', 'family', 'lot', 'parent', 'amazing', 'parent', 'love', 'family', 'trust', 'trust', 'female', 'ldr', 'concern', 'trust', 'standpoint', 'constantly', 'texte', 'thing', 'stuff', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'constant', 'relationship', 'time', 'usually', 'excited', 'hug', 'grab', 'hand', 'think', 'lose', 'interest', 'despite', 'good', 'feel', 'relationship', 'want', 'talk', 'know', 'sound', 'weak', 'needy', 'want', 'hey', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'hey', 'come', 'spend', 'time', 'friend', 'tell', 'unhappy', 'current', 'state', 'relationship', 'know', 'type', 'conversation', 'sound', 'needy', 'unattractive', 'know', 'convo', 'worth', 'work', 'girlfriend', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'me/', 'involved', 'like', 'like', 'maybe', 'conversation', 'work', 'know', 'expect', 'read', 'mind', 'try', 'relationship', 'understand', 'question', 'reiterate', 'pretty', 'busy', 'weekday', 'time', 'busy', 'like', 'work', 'try', 'time', 'work', 'kind', 'shy', 'girl', 'attempt', 'thing', 'friend', 'hang', 'challenge', 'ultimately', 'wonder', 'try', 'wait', 'get', 'well', 'talk', 'unsure', 'option', 'break', 'suppose', 'like', 'thank', 'tl;dr', 'girlfriend', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'feel', 'leave', 'college', 'month', 'sure', 'ldr', 'think', 'happy', 'sure', 'bring', 'need', 'end', 'thing']"
203,8ka8m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ka8m6/i_27f_had_sex_with_my_coworker_38m_and_now_hes/,I [27F] had sex with my coworker [38M] and now he’s being even more distant,"  Some History:

Around the time I started working at my current company, I was befriended by a coworker and the friendship quickly became sexual. We would often sext, both at work and after work, and we would exchange photos – he would also always talk with me via skype at work. At the time, I had started seeing someone, but it was not serious, and it was also not a committed relationship. My coworker knew this, and he did not care. He invited me out for drinks one evening, but, unfortunately, I was spending the day with the other person, so I had to turn him down. 

I noticed a decline in conversation/interest in texting and he would often “ghost” our conversations; however, not long after, the interest picked back up again, and we were sexting – not as often – but enough to have something going. We also occasionally stayed late after work and had a few make out sessions, nothing more. 

Then I met a guy I was really into and we started dating. My coworker, after not having texted me for some time, tried to sext at work and I kindly turned him down – letting him know that I met someone I really liked and was interested in. He said okay, and we stopped texting. 

A few months later, I was broken up with. I wasn’t very heart broken as the relationship hadn’t been great, so I let my coworker know about the break up in hopes that maybe it would spark some ‘fun’ again. I sent a few photos and we had a couple fun texts, but he ended up ghosting most of our convos and wouldn’t talk to me much at work anymore on skype. 

Then my coworker ended up getting very sick. He was out of work for two weeks, and even when he came back – he was very much out of it. On top of it all, he had a very big project that kept him busy at work. At this point, our communication outside of casual work\-related conversations was nonexistent.

The now:

Recently, I was approached by another company to fill a position in need with a very large increase in salary.  I confided this to my coworker, and he told me not to switch positions as the title I have at this company would have more value in the long run than switching now for a salary increase. I don’t entirely believe this, so I ended having a phone interview regardless. I let my coworker know about the phone interview. All the sudden, this seemed to have sparked something in my coworker and he was talking to me again on skype and being a lot more conversational via texting as well. 

Now that we were communicating again, we agreed to stay late together at the office one day and we ended up having sex. During sex, he said a couple things that I don’t know if I should take it how it is or if there is another meaning. He said, “I should have done this sooner” and “I’ve been wanting to this with you for a while”. 

There definitely is chemistry, at least, for me, there is; however, we have always been very honest and open about no dating. He admitted that the reason we haven’t had sex sooner is that he was worried about me wanting to date him in the future/catching feelings. He also didn’t want it to be complicated/awkward. I have reassured him multiple times in the past, and after we had sex that I am not interested in dating and I would just like a fun, casual FWB kind of relationship with him. He seemed okay with this up until a few days ago I sent him a text asking we could have sex at his place instead since the office sex was bad \(just really uncomfortable\). I currently live with my parents and won’t be out until few months from now. He didn’t respond to the text. We ended up having lunch together a few days later, and this time I brought it up in person, and he replied that it’s because it’s his “personal space” and it would be “too much like dating”, to which I retorted “You’re still hung up on this dating thing? I’ve told you that I’m also just interested in something casual”. He just said, “that’s what they all say” and “we’ll see”. 

I sat on what he said, and, I’ll be honest, I was a little annoyed. I feel like I’ve made myself clear on my stance, and that he should understand that we’re both on the same page for this “no dating” thing. I also feel like he’s the one that’s suddenly making things complicated, but I understand it might be a boundaries thing. I ended up sending him a text along the lines of I understand his boundaries, but at the same time – what’s the difference if it’s at the office, my house or his house? I just wanted some place more physically comfortable rather than an office desk, and that I’m not going to go out of my way for some dick. If he wants to have sex, he can let me know – if not, that is cool too. 

He hasn’t texted me back since I asked about his place, and after the text I sent him. I feel like maybe I messed things up, but, at the same time, I don’t regret sending the message because I honestly was getting really annoyed and didn’t think it was fair that it only ever seemed like it was when he wanted it. Casual sex is great, but it’s still a two\-way street in my opinion.

Was I wrong? Should I apologize? How is casual sex supposed to work? Is he being immature by ignoring confrontation? Am I just too confrontational?

TLDR: 

Had a lot of sexual tension with coworker since I started working there, talking on and off, finally had sex, coworker uncomfortable with having sex anywhere but office or when I get my own place, coworker worried about me getting feelings and wanting to date, sent coworker a frustrated text, coworker is ignoring me again

Me (27) SO (22).

September 2015- we meet on a farm in Australia after we have both been through very hard times in our life. We fall in love and help eachother out of some dark holes, it's literally like the fairy tale start to a relationship that lasts for 1 1/2 years which involves various travels around Australia and New Zealand

April 2017 - We break up in New Zealand, her call, and it breaks my heart. She just quickly grew distant and I had no idea why.  I go travelling with 2 friends to distract myself, 2 weeks later my grandad dies, so I return to the UK.

May 2017 - I head to Portugal for the Summer to cheer myself up and work there partying and meeting other people to get over the breakup. During my stay, my SO writes me a huge email telling me she's fucked up and wants me back and goes into complete detail about everything what happenedBasically while we were in New Zealand, her and my friend who came travelling with me, basically had an emotional affair. No cheating involved per say, but basically their was an emotional connection and she was very confused by it. In her words, rather than hurt me, she chose to end the relationship. The dude, who I had no idea was going behind my back messaging my ex, came with me travelling which looking back is so bloody weird. Then my grandad passed away so I left, and a few weeks later him and my SO met up, with her expecting all of her worries of making the wrong decision to be gone. The opposite happened, she saw him after those weeks and then couldn't stop thinking of me. She stayed there for a few days and then left because she couldn't take what she had done, thus began when she wrote the email.

July - January - I had already made plans to travel Canada and America which is what I did, in my mind she was the one who had fucked up so it was down to her to fix it. I wasn't changing my plans. We kept in touch but this was a source of immense emotional agony and really took its toll on me, I struggled to let go and was constantly let down.

January 2018 - The whole relationship has been on my mind for AGES now, so I decide to fly to Australia after finding a cheap flight and begin volunteering at a house in Melbourne for a couple of months, trying to organise me and my ex to meet up so we can finally moveon from this shit. She doesn't have any money as usual, so I take it upon myself to travel to her and let my ego go of wanting her to come to me.

March - April 2018- we meet for the first time in 11 months, expecting to just sit down say sorry for what happened, forgive eachother for our mistakes and move on with our seperate lives. Well that kind of happened, but what also happened was that we fell in love again and ended up spending a fantastic month together. However, then my visa ran out so I had to come to Vietnam, before leaving I said if the distance comes between us, I would return to Australia

May 2018- I've been in Vietnam almost 1 month, and what I predicted is happening. All of those love fueled emotions when we were together have vanished and now my past fears, insecurities and doubts have risen up, and I can't seem to move past them in my mind. I have a flight booked back to Australia in 2 days to see her and see if we can work through this, however once again I'm thinking, maybe I should stay here and make her come to me? That way it would prove she actually loves me, and isn't just using me as a crutch for now to get her through this time in her life. I mean, I feel like I've done my part to bring us back together, isn't it her time to start doing something? But still, if I don't go back, I know I'm really going to hurt someone I love for a reason I'm not even that sure of

Rationally- I could just go back to Australia, see what happens, and if it all goes to shit then just come back. But this does scare me quite a bit, well both decisions scare me but I'm just trying to make the best decision.

Side note is that I suffer with a bit of an anxiety issue that ranges from difficulty making decisions all the way to suicidal thoughts when things get really bad. This was brought on by a past relationship, and I see a lot of similarities starting between this one and that one.  So yeah, that makes me understandably nervous, especially when this current partner has broke my trust before. I understand if you don't want to read all this, but if you do I appreciate it and would like to know your thoughts. Just need to get this out my chest as I am supposed to fly in two days and thought I would of had a feeling what to do by now as I've been thinking about this for weeks.

About a year ago he moved to another state for a job, which I was supportive of and said it would be my decision to make the next move. I’ve been stuck in this position and haven’t been able to make a decision either way (to move or decide to stay) for a year now and need to make a choice. 

I have a good job and family here, but moving to be with him would also be a temporary move since he’s not planning to stay there forever. I do really love him but from time to time I wonder if it’s “perfect” because I’ve never seriously dated anyone else so I have nothing to compare it to.

If I decide to stay, he would eventually come back, but I feel like if I’m not willing to move for him then something in the relationship must not be right - can that be right?  

On the other hand I may regret not moving and really giving the relationship a full chance.

I do love her very much. The only time we weren't together was three weeks last June when I asked her to go on a break so I could try things with this other girl. 

The other girl and I met a little over a year ago and we hit it off right away. During the break I enjoyed spending time with the other girl very much. But I ended up hanging out with my gf three weeks after going on break and it made me realize how much I missed her. We got back together that day and I told the other girl I couldn't see her anymore. She was pissed. I was happy to be back in my relationship for a while, like really happy. I wasn't talking to the other girl anymore and it seemed like I just wanted to focus on my gf from then on. But one day the other girl contacted me because I still had one of her hoodies and she wanted to come by and get it and then leave. I told her it was okay so she did. When she got to my house I saw how angry she was with me and I asked her if she wanted to talk about it for closure. She agreed and we ended up talking for hours and we both realized how much we still wanted to be in each others' lives so we decided to remain friends. about 4 months later she got in a relationship with another guy and I wasn't even jealous. 

We talked all the time and became best friends. But about 6 months later she broke up with him and I started to see her as more than just a friend. This put a huge strain on me and my gf's relationship because my gf would always complain about me being friends with her. Eventually my gf told me she would breakup with me if I didn't stop talking to this her. It was one of the toughest decisions of my life, but as I was lying there in bed, about to lose my gf who I love I couldn't bare to lose her. I wasn't ready for that. I told her I would cut her out of my life for our relationship's sake. 

Fast forward 2 months and I can't stop thinking about this other girl, every single day. I still feel like I can't bare to lose my gf because she's my world... but I'm having a really hard time accepting that I'll never be with this other girl for the rest of my life. I know I'll go into a deep depression and feel regret immediately afterward if I breakup with her. I'm just not sure that I should be in a relationship with her anymore if I think about this other girl every day.

(*edit)

I love my gf so much and I feel so happy just talking to her and when we get together it feels magical. But it doesn't stop me from thinking about the other girl daily.

But my boyfriend and I live together in a house. The house is his. His name is on the deed, he paid for the down payment and the mortgage is in his name. We agreed that we’d “split” everything. So we’ve been living here since mid January and he’s been doing a lot of renovations , more than I can afford. He makes about $300 more a pay check than me. Not to mention, we have a roommate who pays him probably around $400 a month to live with us. 
He told me he is going to put all that money away for an emergency fund or for when our taxes are rated next year. That’s a bunch of bull. He’s only consulted me on buying stuff for the house maybe twice. And all the other stuff, he  Wants me to pay half. I don’t feel it’s warranted because he didn’t ask if I could afford half. Example: he wanted a sound bar for the TV, I said sure as long as it was on the cheaper side. He came home with one about twice the amount I was expecting and I was pissed. I feel stupid for saying I’m not going to pay for half of what he buys without asking me, but I feel it’s warranted because sometimes  we don’t  even need it! The house is in really good shape and a lot of the renovations are just upgrades but all I keep seeing is dollar signs when he just sees something shiny and new. 
My parents don’t even want me paying for the tax s on my half of the mortgage that i pay because th house technically isn’t mine. And I agree. If we were engaged, different story. But there’s no sign of that in the future and I do want that status because it means it’s a little more solid. That may sound naive, but that’s what I think.

210,8k9ziy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k9ziy/28f_my_coworkerfriend_30sf_is_interfering_with/,[28/f] My coworker/friend (30s?/f) is interfering with doctor appointments,"This is my first post ever, so be kind to me please! I much prefer lurking, but I could use some advice. I hope this will make sense. I tried to be vague just in case.

I have a coworker/friend, let's call her Pam. I always give her a ride home from work, because her house is on my way (halfway between work and my home across town). She tags along for any errands I need to run on the way.

I've started going to a new specialist. His office is close to work and very open to family/friends being present for the appointments, which only take about 15 minutes. Pam was happy to go along for my first visit, and I invited her to observe since she was curious about the practice. She watched quietly and we went home. On the next visit, Pam watched again, but not so quietly this time. Pam sometimes talks so much that people cannot get a word in edgewise. Hey, we all have quirks! She had read about the practice, and wondered aloud ""why don't they use this technique, they should have that thingamajig, etc."" She asked the doctor questions like ""why don't you do x this other way"" and ""does that really work?!"" I left feeling that she had taken over, and the doctor hadn't had a chance to say much to me. He didn't ask whether I saw improvement or offer in-depth explanations of the practice that is still very new to me. I feel that he would have if someone else hadn't been talking the whole time, and I know that I would get more out of the visits if I went alone. I need to be able to focus on my own health, ask questions, and listen to what the doctor has to say.

How can I ask Pam to stay in the waiting room without hurting her feelings, or find an indirect way to keep her from being present? I know she didn't intentionally interfere, and I feel that her talking A LOT with no filter is a personality trait that she probably can't help. I also talk too much (only at home though) and I am always surprised and a little hurt when my boyfriend points it out, because I never realize how much I'm talking and how annoying it is! I can't use office rules as an excuse, since Pam already knows they welcome friends and family. I've considered insisting on taking Pam home first or scheduling appointments during my lunch break or later in the day, all of which would be too inconvenient and/or waste too much gas. I guess I just need to be straight with Pam, but need advice on how to do it without hurting her feelings too badly. I am so bad at being direct because I never want to come off as rude or mean.

When I talked to her about it in person she told me I was too cruel and that I made fun of her too much. I thought I was being light hearted and that she thought it was funny but I guess I stepped over the line without realizing it. I felt really horrible about it afterwards and since we still shared a class together it was painfully awkward. I tried apologizing over text but she blocked me and I was too immature to do it in person. The class ended and I thought we would go separate ways. I just recently came to find out we’re going to the same college and it’s a fairly small arts school so we’re likely to have some classes together. I want to be better about it this time just to lessen the awkward tension and maybe try to recoup some kind of friendship. How should I go about doing this? Ps. I know I acted like a retard any advice on how to be better moving forward would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thereres  a lot of stuff that are missing pertaining to my relationship with this woman. I've helped her with a lot of personal stuff that i wouldnt like to mention but i feel i may have reacted badly upon reflection. Idk whats going on. I mean this woman used to stalk me as well but this would make this way to long. Drove by my house and i never gave her my address thats how bad the stalking was and i live 40 mins away from her!!! We both have anxiety and she time to time gets depression but she is not depressed nor feeling awkward because i asked already a week ago

I'm about fed up with this ignoring game that i finally reacted to what this woman is doing to me. This has been going on for the past 3 weeks. Right after spring semester was done for us uni students in usa. I met her 2yrs ago in one class we didnt talk much but she would always look at me etc. We talked a little bit. Long story short I really liked her from that semester but i regretted not talking to her more. A yr goes by and i meet her where i transferred. I hit up a conversation and everything is booming. She needed help with coding so i helped out. From then on i helped(practically did every single assignment for her) for this class and we studied together always. We would hangout, go out and eat, cook for each other etc. We got really close the more we learned about each other the more we realized how similar we are in every way. We would always spend to alone one on one and she loved each time we hung out because at the end of this semester she went on a long rant on all the good times we had and she told me she likes me a lot and would love to make great memories with me. She said ""i always make her feel better"" reason is she fell into a deep depression and i'd do all i can to comfort her. Her depression would make her stress and make her sick(she would throw up). When she would get sick i'd cook and do things to help her out etc.  This semester she failed every exam i did all her assignments labs and quize(all A's) and gets a B. 



During this semester we texted everyday. When i wouldnt text because i felt at times i was annoying her or she wasn't interested she would blow up my phone and call. We are so close we even give each others schedules, sign up for classes together. She will be at work and tell me how work is going even if i dont ask or tell me when she will be out to meet up etc. As of now she doesnt do that.



We go out on a date to a restaurant. Before this we went on a hike and it was fun she enjoyed her time. When we got to the restaurant she refuses to let me pay but we have a great time chatting. 



Next semester flows along everything is great. Im still doing her assignments and labs and helping out a great deal. There were weekends where i'd spend an entire day or two helping her out(dead serious). This assignment took me two full days and others would take me days to figure out. At times when we would spend a weekend together she might ignore me but then get back to me. This semester i cancelled a lot of events, meetings etc just to help her out. Two months into the semester we start chatting about relationships and mind you this started from 9pm our convo ended at 2am. Why? She came to the conclusion that she sees me as a friend. I was mind boggled like why tf do you get mad if i dont message you etc. Mind you we are going on dates long walks etc and im doing all i can to help her. 



I start to ignore her and not pay any attention to her and start talking to another woman she sees that and starts sending me pics of her and just texting me constantly. I go back and we go on another long walk and have a great time. She starts to be more physical and touchy and kept blushing all the time. Sometimes she would ignore sometimes she wouldnt. We would chat a lot via text etc.



People seriously thought we were dating because where ever i was she was. We would always be together or if she is going to do something she wants me to come along.



The end of this semester ends we talk as soon as she gets her grade she responds i got a b. I respond she responds three days later. I'm like what happened she goes i went to so and so and did this and this and this like B.S lol. She sends me another pic of her cheezing herself off. I ask ""you snap chatted everything right?"" she says ""yep "" and sends me videos and more photos. Like wtf i sent 3 days ago in my mind but ignore this. 




Side note she is addicted to her phone(glued to it like no other) we will be conversing she will whip it out, at work constantly on it, group meeting on it(most horrible and embarassing part was when someone was trying to get her attention and she was lost), im helping her study on it, doing hw on it she cant stay off of it for 2 mins literally. I know her all to well. Before anyone says she is probably busy she is never busy never i mean ever. 



She goes on to do this and today i react because enough of this crap. I spent way to much time helping a person just to get ignored as if i did something wrong when i know i didnt. Is she testing me or something? Wth is this it makes no sense what so ever. She said she hates drama which is why she doesnt have a lot of woman friends but way more guy friends. 



 She responds 12+hrs later yet she is responding to everyone else normally



Im seriously shocked of all people that i know this is the person doing this to me and i have no idea why or what is causing this and it is childish and immature to just blatantly ignore someone who wishes the best and helps in every way. I wait a couple of minutes and reply. I called her out tonight and she didnt respond. 



Theres a lot id like to say like her stalking me etc but this would make this way to long.

tl:dr I help this woman in everything we do everything together! We are so close that everyone who see us constantly together think we are dating. Despite all i've done for her she is ignoring me for some reason but talking to everyone else normally. She is at work replying to everyone else. Today i replied to her message at 10am which she sent a reply to my message from last night at 8am. She has been constnatly doing this right after the semester ended. Am i being used? Is this how people treat others who help them?

Here's my issue: I'm really emotionally attracted to her, but physically I'm not really attracted to her at all. I'm wondering how important everyone thinks this is. Honestly, I feel like there's a ton of chemistry between us, more than I've had with anyone really.

My boyfriend and I have been dating almost 11 months, had been very good friends for about 6 years prior, and I am his first girlfriend ever. The relationship is actually going very well, few bumps, lots of love.

When we got together, we both were well aware that we would be attending different colleges, about 12 hours away from each other. We have been long distance since about two months in, and that hasn’t been much of a problem either. We always talk about a future together, moving in, getting married, having kids, all that.

People always say not to settle down so quickly and get to know what you like, experiment, wander around if you will. I guess the purpose of this post is that, and we’ve talked about this before, with me being his first girlfriend, one of my biggest insecurities is that he will eventually feel like he hasn’t experienced a lot and will want to experience other people.

With him being away and meeting new people all the time, I guess it just makes the insecurity a little stronger. He has always been very committed, we have a very open line of communication, it’s just very scary. When we talked about it a couple months ago, he said that he didn’t find it weird that he wants to spend his life with me even though this is his first relationship. He’s been on dates with other before, but had nothing like us, and he says nothing else panned out because they were not right for him and I was, which makes me feel a little better lol.

Has anyone else experienced this and what was your thought process like? Did you end up pushing your significant other away, in a sense? Because I feel like that could possibly happen. Any advice or stories would be very much appreciated!","['fear', 'want', 'experience', 'people', '20_f/19_m', 'hey', 'guy', 'actually', 'post', 'bear', 'little', 'ramble', 'y', 'boyfriend', 'date', '11', 'month', 'good', 'friend', '6', 'year', 'prior', 'girlfriend', 'relationship', 'actually', 'go', 'bump', 'lot', 'love', 'get', 'aware', 'attend', 'different', 'college', '12', 'hour', 'away', 'long', 'distance', 'month', 'problem', 'talk', 'future', 'move', 'get', 'marry', 'have', 'kid', 'people', 'settle', 'quickly', 'know', 'like', 'experiment', 'wander', 'guess', 'purpose', 'post', 'talk', 'girlfriend', 'big', 'insecurity', 'eventually', 'feel', 'like', 'experience', 'lot', 'want', 'experience', 'people', 'away', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'time', 'guess', 'make', 'insecurity', 'little', 'strong', 'commit', 'open', 'line', 'communication', 'scary', 'talk', 'couple', 'month', 'ago', 'say', 'find', 'weird', 'want', 'spend', 'life', 'relationship', 'date', 'like', 'say', 'pan', 'right', 'make', 'feel', 'little', 'well', 'lol', 'experience', 'thought', 'process', 'like', 'end', 'push', 'significant', 'away', 'sense', 'feel', 'like', 'possibly', 'happen', 'advice', 'story', 'appreciate']"

My boyfriend and I met our freshman year of college. School started in late August, I met him mid September, and we started dating a week after meeting.

While things have always been fine between us, I sometimes find myself looking back and wondering if we went too fast? He was my first, and it makes sense that I feel very connected to him just on that level.

He is very kind-hearted, loving, attractive, and his family is great, but when it comes to our personalities we differ. While we like the same things, he never seems very comfortable engaging with my friends and family. Our styles of humor are very different and when it comes down to it, I find myself somewhat bored with our discussions.

Currently, we are working in separate states for the summer, and when we call and talk about our days it is very standard. I'm trying extremely hard to keep in mind that we communicate better in person, but it still is rough and dragging. I know we have been together for a long time, but it just feels like we never engage  when talking. 

I've started at my new job, and was instructed to shadow my coworker. He and I have to spend lots of time together in the lab because of the job nature, and from the downtime of waiting on machines, we have talked a lot about ourselves.

I can't figure out why, but he makes me laugh like I never have before. I can't help but feel sexually attracted to him, which is even more frustrating because I do not want it to be an issue while working together. At the same time, I am someone who has a serious boyfriend, so what the fuck am I doing having this kind of work-based relationship?

I feel almost sick with the thought of hurting my boyfriend; but these feelings for my coworker are making me realize that maybe I need to take a step back and look at my relationship. I'm worried I'm wanting to evaluate things with my boyfriend strictly because of my coworker, but I also believe there are fundamental things I'm unhappy with (conversation) that must be addressed, coworker or not.

Luckily, the coworker will be gone by Wednesday (I'm sort of replacing him) but I worry that there might be another incident like this that occurs if I don't address this problem.

Thoughts?

This is my first time posting to this subreddit, so bear with me.

I'm [22/M] I have been with my girlfriend [21/F] for a year and some change. We have both fucked up in our relationship, but we are trying to work things out.

She has been disloyal and dishonest, and it gives me extreme anxiety when she drinks, or just hangs out with guys. I don't act controlling, but the fact that I get upset when she drinks, or is with guys by herself really sucks.

I am seeking out therapy to work through my trust issues, becasue I love her and want to be with her very badly, but tomorrow she has a guy from her work coming over to look at her car (we don't currently live together) and I am extremely anxious and it's all I can think about and I don't want to say anything to upset her or start a fight.

I don't know what to do, and at this point I honestly don't know if I will ever completely trust her again, which sucks to think about. I really love this girl.

He noticed I wasn’t looking to good from how much I drank and he suggested I laid down for a bit and drink water. We went to his room and at first were just cuddling. I remember getting very sleepy and then him starting to go down on me but I wasn’t doing much because I literally had no energy to move because of how drunk I was eventually he started touching me and then some stuff must have happened in between because I felt him inside of me in.. the other hole. I felt way to tired and dizzy to react so I guess I kind of just let him. It all happened kind of fast and I don’t remember much of it.

I sat down with my friends and 2 out of the 4 said they felt absolutely awful and responsible for causing the break up whereas the other 2 still dont give a shit and are just happy our relationship is over. The 2 friends who felt bad told me that If I really wanted to be with her and regretted the decision to end I should talk to her and try and get back together with her. so I messaged her today and apologised profusely saying how I should of let the opinions of others affect our reltionship and she insisted that there was no need to apologise as I has done nothing and it was my friends who were in the wrong. We spoke for about 5 minutes mainly me just telling her how stupid I feel then she told me its getting too much and said she needed to go. Where do I go from here?

I first thought he was not serious, and went too far with joking. He is hurt. How should I handle the situation ?","Hi everyone, 


Some background :


We have been together a bit less than a year and live together. He believes in paranormal and, though I do not share his opinion, I showed myself respectful about it.


My boyfriend has depression and so do I. I am in therapy, he starts tomorrow. In the past he showed himself to be disrespectful during arguments (blaming me for his wounds when he broke a closet door, or because the controller somehow isn’t connected to the console and I slept next to it, calling me names, getting angry and yelling at me, this kind of things) and I confronted him about it after a few months of doubting myself and walking on eggshells. I told him I would leave if he could not respect me, because I wasn’t going to ignore the no1 value I need in a relationship. I lust admit I may have gone a bit too fast mentioning breakup this way. He apologized and was very hurt that I threatened to leave. It’s the very first time I stood up for myself and said such a thing, but I meant it.


Tonight, while cuddling, YouTube stopped working, turning the music off. He told me it was because of the playlist and to just switch to another one. I then took the controller and did what he told me mechanically. 


YouTube still would not work, so he proceeded to blame the bug on me, saying that I have some kind of malediction, because « every time you touch the controller there is some issue with it ». Ok, there has been like 3-4 occurrences in the last six months of me being near the PS4 and it stopping working, but it was about it. I thought he was joking. Really. I said things like « yeah, aha. I’m sure there is some kind of demon bewitching the console every time I touch it » ; « ahah a malediction » ; but also added things like « it makes no sense, I never had any kind of problem with computers, consoles and even this one when it was home » (it’s my dad’s PS4) ; « when I use it it usually works, it’s just a coincidence ». I never thought his belief in ghosts could be linked to this, which is another mistake. I should have realized sooner.


He stayed very serious. « Yes it’s your fault, you have some kind of malediction ». I asked him if he really believed in it and he confirmed but at this point he really was on the defensive. I was a bit confused. Probably because it was about me. I went too far with my joking, but my last mistake was when I added « it works fine when I use it and you’re not home », to which he replied « I’m not saying it’s all the time ». 


At that point he told me I was not respecting him. That I felt free to point out his lack of respect but I was acting similarly. I apologized and said I thought he was joking, I’m sorry. He went to bed. 


Now he is sleeping and I am overthinking but unable to take a step back. I don’t know if it makes any sense to try to show him that he is wrong. I tried in the past and he probably will get angrier if anything. Does respecting his beliefs about paranormal includes letting him believe I have a curse when there has been a lot of occurrences where I use the controller and everything is fine ? Should I just tell him « thinking this is ok but don’t blame me for these occurrences because I don’t share your belief » ? How could I even be cursed « some of the time » ? Should I ask for information about malédictions from him ?


Thanks for reading if you made it this far. :) And sorry for the potential English mistakes (not a native speaker). Any advice or experience is appreciated !


TL;DR : Boyfriend blamed some PS4 bug on me, affirming I had some kind of malediction. I went too far with joking, even when I understood he was actually not. I apologized, he went to bed hurt and now I don’t know what to do. I know I should respect his beliefs, but I don’t want him to blame ME if it’s « a malediction ». I know proving myself right would go too far (statistics statistics). Should I ask him for info about it ? I’m lost and genuinely sorry but so confused.","['20_f', 'boyfriend', '20_m', 'genuinely', 'believe', 'curse', 'ps4', 'think', 'go', 'far', 'joking', 'hurt', 'handle', 'situation', 'hi', 'background', 'bit', 'year', 'live', 'believe', 'paranormal', 'share', 'opinion', 'show', 'respectful', 'boyfriend', 'depression', 'i.', 'therapy', 'start', 'tomorrow', 'past', 'show', 'disrespectful', 'argument', 'blame', 'wound', 'break', 'closet', 'door', 'controller', 'connect', 'console', 'sleep', 'call', 'name', 'get', 'angry', 'yell', 'kind', 'thing', 'confront', 'month', 'doubt', 'walk', 'eggshell', 'tell', 'leave', 'respect', 'go', 'ignore', 'no1', 'value', 'need', 'relationship', 'lust', 'admit', 'go', 'bit', 'fast', 'mention', 'breakup', 'way', 'apologize', 'hurt', 'threaten', 'leave', 'time', 'stand', 'say', 'thing', 'mean', 'tonight', 'cuddle', 'youtube', 'stop', 'work', 'turn', 'music', 'tell', 'playlist', 'switch', 'take', 'controller', 'tell', 'mechanically', 'youtube', 'work', 'proceed', 'blame', 'bug', 'say', 'kind', 'malediction', '  ', 'time', 'touch', 'controller', 'issue', '  ', 'ok', 'like', '3', '4', 'occurrence', 'month', 'near', 'ps4', 'stop', 'working', 'think', 'joke', 'say', 'thing', 'like', '  ', 'yeah', 'aha', 'sure', 'kind', 'demon', 'bewitch', 'console', 'time', 'touch', '  ', '  ', 'ahah', 'malediction', '  ', 'add', 'thing', 'like', '  ', 'make', 'sense', 'kind', 'problem', 'computer', 'console', 'home', '  ', 'dad', 'ps4', '  ', 'use', 'usually', 'work', 'coincidence', '  ', 'think', 'belief', 'ghost', 'link', 'mistake', 'realize', 'sooner', 'stay', '  ', 'yes', 'fault', 'kind', 'malediction', '  ', 'ask', 'believe', 'confirm', 'point', 'defensive', 'bit', 'confused', 'probably', 'go', 'far', 'joking', 'mistake', 'add', '  ', 'work', 'fine', 'use', 'home', '  ', 'reply', '  ', 'say', 'time', '  ', 'point', 'tell', 'respect', 'feel', 'free', 'point', 'lack', 'respect', 'act', 'similarly', 'apologize', 'say', 'think', 'joke', 'sorry', 'go', 'bed', 'sleep', 'overthinke', 'unable', 'step', 'know', 'make', 'sense', 'try', 'wrong', 'try', 'past', 'probably', 'angry', 'respect', 'belief', 'paranormal', 'include', 'let', 'believe', 'curse', 'lot', 'occurrence', 'use', 'controller', 'fine', 'tell', '  ', 'think', 'ok', 'blame', 'occurrence', 'share', 'belief', '  ', 'curse', '  ', 'time', '  ', 'ask', 'information', 'malédiction', 'thank', 'read', 'far', 'sorry', 'potential', 'english', 'mistake', 'native', 'speaker', 'advice', 'experience', 'appreciate', 'tl;dr', 'boyfriend', 'blame', 'ps4', 'bug', 'affirm', 'kind', 'malediction', 'go', 'far', 'joking', 'understand', 'actually', 'apologize', 'go', 'bed', 'hurt', 'know', 'know', 'respect', 'belief', 'want', 'blame', '  ', 'malediction', '  ', 'know', 'prove', 'right', 'far', 'statistic', 'statistic', 'ask', 'info', 'lose', 'genuinely', 'sorry', 'confused']"

Am I just being hypersensitive now or should I try to talk to her about it? My general idea on what to do is just be the exact same.

The second thing is what are some ways, either through body language, just in general, or even through texts, to move things forward and get more intimate. I have been doing my best to overcome the nervousness that comes from talking with girls at my level of experience. I think the biggest thing I need to do on that front is just to continue to build the relationship until I feel like my comfortable, normal self when I'm around her.

I’m not so great at taking things slow.. lol if it was up to me, we would move back in together like tomorrow.. does anyone have advice on getting back together with an ex?

I should mention that before I had texted her she reached out to my friend and said that I hadn't yet set anything up, so she was clearly still interested. 

I'm not upset, nor salty, I'm rather perplexed. Why back-channel through my friend that you were interested, only to blow me off? Is it a power play or is she just looking for attention?

So, i am only 15 yrs old (03) and i got a crush on this girl, right? normal. but i haven't felt any love for someone in probably four years because a shit long-distance relationship that wasn''t real love. 

we never talked to eachother that much and our mothers were best friends since they were kids so that probably has a reason to do with us being together. after a whole year. not long after our anniversary we broke up. we never kissed, and i was a very shy person back then and i guess i am a little bit shy now too. 


But that fucked me six ways to Sunday, but i was still not that sad about it weirdly.. like after one hour i was done with it and moved on. (Is that weird? for a 12 yr old?). So i started developing trust issues (i guess?). And after that i haven't felt something towards another person as special as a few weeks ago.


So she has been in my class 2 years now. Soon to be 3 years, in this high-school (Norwegians start middle/high-school at 13 (i think) so those who started this year is '04.. whatever.. this has nothing to do with this story, sorry). And she was in love with me in 8th grade. But she didn't have feelings for me (as i can recall, i am talking to her best friend and she could obviously hide stuff from me). Like, a few weeks ago. 


And a few days ago, i got invited to a party (i guess you could call it a party). around a lavvo (google it), And we played spin the bottle with my crush and 3 other people and her best friend is there and she want's to try to get us together. my crush already knows i like her. (and this is where my confusion kicks in). We had a great time, me and my crush. and she wanted to always take her behind the lavvo to talk to her multiple times. And i think that is weird. is it??. Anyways, we were going to play spin the bottle all five of us. and the bottle pointed to her, or me. and (INSERT_NAME_HERE) wanted her to kiss me on the cheek (as she does). Some turns afterwards the bottle turns to me and they want us to kiss... keep in mind that this was my very first kiss and my head just went like: WOW, WE ARE REALLY GOING TO DO THIS, MY BOY? ARE YOU EVEN READY???. And i went up to her and we kissed (with my teeth touching her lips... is that bad?, and i did the same the third time. More on that later). Her best friend says it's sweet that i can't kiss :P. Some turns afterwards, the bottle turned to a friend and the she could choose what other friend she wanted to kiss. And the one didn't want to so of course my crush's best friend suggested that me and my crush would kiss again. she accepted and i of course did too. i kissed a bit more normal but i didn't like peck my lips again. was too nervous i guess, couldn't focus. and 30 minutes passed and i was about to go and my crush's best friend wanted her to hug me as a goodbye hug, ya know. and the best friend whispered to me that i should after the hug kiss her on the cheek and say let's talk on snapchat. when the hug came and after that i just froze up and i just stared at her for a second.. and the she said ""let's do it"" or something like that. it was pretty inaudible. and then reached for a kiss. and i wasn't prepared and.. oooh shit.. there goes the teeth again.. well damn.. i couldn't say anything to her now i just said goodbye.


Now, i feel like this was very faked. probably because i thought this would never happen. It felt too good for me. and the last kiss i am not sure of if it were real or not. and if i were bamboozled for my first kiss... i meant that's fucked. Her best friend said my crush wanted to kiss me but now...lik..idk. Now i need help. is this real? Does this sound real? I have thought about it 2 days now. like... idfk.. please help me and my love life!

237,8k8qdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k8qdy/relationship_falling_apart/,Relationship Falling Apart,"Hello.

I need some relationship advice badly, and I will truly be grateful for any help provided. This is quite lengthy, so thank you to whoever who is reading this.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 4 years. Let's call him J. We met on the internet back then. When I went into the relationship with J, I did not completely let go of my ex \(T\). I was afraid to be lonely. I guess you can call it a re\-bound relationship. He had some traits which were similar to that of T's, and I think that was why I chose to be with him. When we were in a relationship, I hurt J over and over again by going back to T. I guess you can call me a cheater. J was depressed at that point of time. He even tried suicide, but that did not stop me from going back to T. Somehow in the end my relationship with T just couldn't work, so long story short,  I went back to J for the companionship I badly needed.

At first, J was reluctant to trust me completely. After all, I've hurt his feelings in the past for a couple of times.  I could understand. I worked hard to get his trust back. After a while, he was more willing to give me his trust. I did not contact T at all anymore \-  I still don't today. He was still loving at the beginning. But I think J's feelings for me has changed after a couple of months. He started to go out with his friends all the time, and I would just tag along. We hardly get any quality time together. Even if we were alone, he would be on his phone all the time, playing games, watching videos, surfing the net, etc. I tried communicating with him, but he thinks that I was overreacting. We fought a lot because of this problem. I no longer feel assured in the relationship. I also caught him texting other girls and watching a movie with one of them, but again, I forgave him. Maybe a part of me wanted to make up for the wrongs I had done him in the past. I can no longer trust him completely.

We were living together at his parents house not long after we got together. Sometimes, when we argue, things would turn violent. I am the hot\-headed type of person, and I certainly have problems controlling my anger, that's why we always fight. I get too sensitive and take things too personally. We fought and hit each other. There was once when he hit my face, and my nose bled. Other times, my body would be bruised, but it was not very serious. I considered leaving at that time, but he promised he would not repeat it again. But this happened for quite a number of times. The physical violence has stopped for about a year now. When we fight, he would use passive aggression by saying things like ""If you're not happy, why don't you just leave?"" or ""What's the point of being in a relationship when it tires both of us?"" I hate it when he does that. I still feel unsafe and scared when we argue, no matter physically or emotionally. I am afraid that he might lose it again. I can't trust him and make myself vulnerable anymore. I have promised myself over and over again that if he does it again, I will leave him. But I never do.

Just two months ago, he left the city and went to Singapore to work, so that marks the beginning of our long distance relationship. In the beginning, everything was fine. He came back two weeks ago to celebrate his mother's birthday. I discovered messages that he sent to other girls on his phone. When I question him, he said that I was intruding his privacy. The contents of the text messages were not extremely intimate, but enough to threaten my trust for him. He was also in groups where they have gatherings every weekend. He went back to Singapore after a week. He often told me he missed me before then. But recently, he has started showing signs of impatience when I call him. He said I am too clingy and dependent on him. I got angry and hung up on him. After that, I texted him and told him that if he does not initiate communication, nor will I text him in the future. He did text me the day after, but it was only four messages, to which all I replied, but in a ""I\-don't\-care\-much"" manner. God knows how much I care. I feel like he longer tries to make an effort in the relationship. I don't know if he is manipulative, or that I am just far too sensitive. In the relationship, I feel like I'm the only one trying. He knows that I love him more than he loves me. I have considered breaking things up, but I still love him.

Note: he has mentioned this back then when he was still here \- that he wants freedom to go out with his friends, that he does not like to be controlled. I am more of an introvert, and I do not have many friends. I rarely go out with anyone besides him in these four years. He asked me, ""do you not have any friends?"" I personally feel offended. He knows that I do not like mixing with others, and that he is the only one I can turn to for companionship.

I really feel on the verge of losing my mind now. I don't know what I should do \- whether I should just call it off or be patient and try harder. Please help.

He kept telling me that I was his perfect dream girl and that he wanted to marry me one day so I stayed. I was under the impression that they were just friends. Found out a few months later that they were still sleeping together and I was ready to leave but he was so apologetic and pulled me back in by telling me how much he loved me and how he would regret losing me every single day of his life blah blah. Fast forward to a few months, he is still sleeping with her and she knows I exist and he just keeps telling me I'm not the side chick and that he cares about me a lot.

I feel like I'm in so deep and I'm always crying my eyes out over him because I just wanted us to be together. Lost my virginity to him in the middle of this whole mess. I feel so angry all the time and I don't know how to leave the situation. And I dont even want to leave without hurting him back. I want him to miss me as much as I'll miss him. I ended up telling his girlfriend a little bit about us because I wanted to get back at him. Ended with me crying to him apologizing and him telling me to shut up because he couldn't focus on his video game. He still keeps saying that he loves me but he wants to be single but he can't cut her out of his life because he cheated on her before but he's still having sex with her and he doesn't care that I know.

I sound like such an emotional wreck and that's literally what I am right now. Can't even tell my friends about it because I didn't listen to them or the voice in my head telling me to end it months ago. I feel so lost and hurt and anxious all the time like I might seriously have a heart attack from all the stress. 

I hate myself for being so needy. I miss being happy and independent and confident. I feel like he broke me completely and I don't know how to pick myself back up. I spent the last six months caring about him and giving him all of me and being there for him when he needed me. 

How do I move past this? It seems impossible. And I honestly hate myself for still wanting to be with him after all this time.

I just want to disappear from the world for a while.","['20_f', 'struggle', 'anxiety', 'breakdown', 'toxic', 'relationship', '20_m', 'involve', 'guy', 'month', 'find', 'little', 'early', 'break', 'girlfriend', 'keep', 'tell', 'perfect', 'dream', 'girl', 'want', 'marry', 'day', 'stay', 'impression', 'friend', 'find', 'month', 'later', 'sleep', 'ready', 'leave', 'apologetic', 'pull', 'tell', 'love', 'regret', 'lose', 'single', 'day', 'life', 'blah', 'blah', 'fast', 'forward', 'month', 'sleep', 'know', 'exist', 'keep', 'tell', 'chick', 'care', 'lot', 'feel', 'like', 'deep', 'cry', 'eye', 'want', 'lose', 'virginity', 'middle', 'mess', 'feel', 'angry', 'time', 'know', 'leave', 'situation', 'not', 'want', 'leave', 'hurt', 'want', 'miss', 'miss', 'end', 'tell', 'girlfriend', 'little', 'bit', 'want', 'end', 'cry', 'apologize', 'tell', 'shut', 'focus', 'video', 'game', 'keep', 'say', 'love', 'want', 'single', 'cut', 'life', 'cheat', 'have', 'sex', 'care', 'know', 'sound', 'like', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'literally', 'right', 'tell', 'friend', 'listen', 'voice', 'head', 'tell', 'end', 'month', 'ago', 'feel', 'lost', 'hurt', 'anxious', 'time', 'like', 'seriously', 'heart', 'attack', 'stress', 'hate', 'needy', 'miss', 'happy', 'independent', 'confident', 'feel', 'like', 'break', 'completely', 'know', 'pick', 'spend', 'month', 'care', 'give', 'need', 'past', 'impossible', 'honestly', 'hate', 'want', 'time', 'want', 'disappear', 'world']"

242,8k8jjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k8jjs/new_best_friend_suddenly_hates_me/,New Best friend suddenly hates me,"Hello so a little backstory here.

Me \(19 M\) and this girl \(22\) started talking to each other about 3 months ago online through discord which we use as a voice programme to play games/chill out on. We have known each other for about a year give or take but one day she pops up asking if im busy and if i wanna talk. So i'm like sure and we enter a private call and we chill out for a couple of hours. Fast forward a few weeks and we are talking every single day and having 6/7 hour sessions where we are just talking to each other alone or with our friends. At this point i will admit i had started getting some feelings for her and decided it would be best to talk to her about it. Now this part is important, Whilst i was turned down and we continued our friendship she was excellent at not making it awkward between us. It got brought up jokingly a few times and we just laughed it off. Again fast forwarding we are still extremely close and consider each other best friends. We know lots of personal things about each other and have told each other some secrets that other people do not know. About 5 days ago she starts acting a bit weird around me, hardly chatting to me in DM's and when we are in voice together being a bit distant. So i asked her ""Hey is everything okay between us"" and i got a response that i wasn't expecting.

She had basically said that she felt as if i only got on to play games whenever she was on and i would just wait around for her to play games and join with her and that she feels that we both need to take a step back because it feels like we are in a relationship and that i am trying to spend every second with her.  At first i was a bit shocked and did the obvious ""Can i call you can we talk about this"", ""Hey we need to talk"" and i would just get the same responses. ""Nah i'm not in the mood"" Which was fine i decided she probably just wanted some breathing room and that maybe i had been a bit too much for her. So we don't talk at all for a couple of days and then im in a voice channel with some of my friends and she joins and we just start chatting like normal again. However when everyone else logs off and its just us alone in the room it's suddenly ""I'm gonna go off and watch some netflix or youtube, bhai"" and this happens a few times over and over again. 

Recently she starts acting a bit snarky towards me and even a little hostile. I've asked for some advice from personal friends and it's the same, give her space. I spoke to my brother and he said that unfortunately when something like this happens it usually means the relationship of any kind is over but if i want it to continue just continue talking to her as if she was a normal friend and don't ask her if it's okay to talk to her, okay to join the channel with her. Do what i want and if she isn't into it she will tell me or she will leave.

I really don't want the friendship to end between us but im at wit's end here and haven't got a clue where to go from here. If any of you have had similar problems and have managed to deal with them just let me know your experience in the matter or any advice you could give me to either let it go or to help mend the relationship.

We became friends a couple of years ago and the friendship has just become more and more intense. 

We don't live near each other but we go to the same college. She keeps saying how excited she is to get back to college so that we can spend every waking minute together. She has asked to live in the same dorm as me. She texts me about 100 times a day. When I am in the mood to chat, I do reply to these texts and we have long conversations about anything and everything. But when I don't reply to these texts, she sulks and generally gets very upset and sends me lots of texts like 'why are you ignoring me?!?' She has quite complex mental health problems and sometimes I do worry that I will make her dangerously unhappy (she has attempted suicide in the past) if I don't reply to her. 

She is very negative about anything I enjoy doing. I am wary about telling her something like 'I just went for a really nice walk' or 'I saw Lucy today and it was really good to talk to her.' If I do say anything positive, she is immediately jealous and tries to belittle me. I have found that I am wary about telling her about anything good happening in my life. 

She is very keen to hate on people. She likes to gossip about people we know and say how ugly/fat/obnoxious they are. I do find that most of our conversations just become times to moan about everything. 

She hates her degree course at college. I just find her so draining. She hates all my friends for various reasons and will regularly tell me how much she hates them. I do feel sorry for her as I know she has some serious issues with self-esteem and so on. And we do have a laugh occasionally and she is very sympathetic. But everything we do laugh about is an in-joke. Everyone has to have a nickname and everything has to be in code. It's like we have our own special language. I just find it stifling and possessive.

I've been friends with this girl going on a year now. She was a friend of a friend, came in our group and we just kinda clicked, so to speak. We started hanging out alone more and more, we could talk for hours, or do nothing and still be okay with it. 

Our frienship became really physical as the time went on, just full on hugging, touching hre and there, or she would be in my arms as we lay, stuff like that. All of a sudden, I started developing feelings for her, and because how our relationship became really relaxed and 'touchy feely', I thought it is the same with her. Yet it still felt like I was just a best friend, like there was a 'wall' between us that stopped her from crossing the line between friends and lovers. 

After some time, she got a job in another city, went there and after month or two, got a boyfriend. And I got over it and, really unexpectedly got into a relationship myself. We kinda drifted apart for a while, but she told me after 2 months that she's single again. 

Fast forward another couple of months, my relationship ended pretty badly, when I realized I was just used... at the same time, she came back and we started hanging out again, like the old times. And again, touching continued like it was yesterday that we last seen eachother. 

And here we are, she was at my place last night, we got some drinks, and got a little tipsy. She wanted a massage, I obliged, and to get straight to the point, ass was grabbed... continously :) after that, we cuddled. We fell asleep just for a little bit, and then she went home. 

The problem is, I still feel like that 'wall' still exists, like, she's that kind of person, you know, relaxed and loves the attention, and nothing more. My gut feeling is rarely, if at all wrong, might I say. And I feel the old flame is starting to burn again. So, should I just say it to her outright, all cards on the table, or test the waters more? I'm fucking confused.

Basically, I constantly feel like everything I’m experiencing (without him) is a waste. Like my time is being wasted, alone. He was my first love, first everything. 
Can’t reach out to him, tried that. 
Because of this, I feel horribly desperate...it’s like I’m running after something that I want so bad, but I know I’ll never actually catch it. It’s the worst feeling that causes me to have anxiety, especially when I’m back in my hometown and suddenly he’s 15 minutes away. I don’t know what to do anymore. In a few weeks I’ll be getting therapy. But I just can’t believe it’s gotten to that point. Am I alone in these feelings? Am I just so mentally weak that I feel this way??  I don’t understand why this affected me so badly that, at some times, I really do feel like it’d be better to just not exist anymore, to avoid the pain and sadness and longing.

My son is 20 years old and just finished his third year of college. He hasn't been doing that well in school. He has many C's on his transcript, a few D's and even a few F's. He did very well in high school. He graduated with a 3.9 GPA. In college, his GPA is a 2.5. He tells me that high school was easier than college, which is why he's having a hard time. He did pretty well his first few semesters, but ever since he lost his scholarship for being unable to maintain the GPA requirement, he's been doing very poorly. From looking at his transcript he did pretty decent his first few semesters, and now he's been doing poorly.

He's a Biology major. He told me that the classes he's taking are not difficult, he just said that it's hard for him to focus. He tells me, he procrastinates, he has a hard time starting assignments that's going to take a while to finish, he has trouble reading long passages, starting essays, etc. But a lot of people that don't have ADHD have the same problems he has, so I don't think it's ADHD that's causing him to do this. I just think he's not trying his hardest and is distracted because he spends a lot of time on his laptop just surfing the net instead of studying.

He says reading long passages is difficult for him, but a lot of people don't like to read. He paces back and forth in our house, he fidgets when sitting for a while, he says he daydreams a lot, but I just think he needs to learn how to control that. He doesn't have a driver's license because he says he doesn't pay attention that well, and he doesn't feel safe to drive. I just think he haven't practiced driving enough to come to that conclusion. He tells me whenever he leaves a movie at a movie theatre, he falls asleep and fidgets in his seat. He tells me he never remembers what happened in the film. Many people fall asleep at the movies. I don't think that's ADHD.

My son went to his GP to talk about this, and his GP told him ""you probably do have ADHD from what you've described."" He told him he has to visit a Psychiatrist for further testing and to get prescribed medication. I don't think he needs to go to a Psychiatrist. If he gets diagnosed, that's through the whole state, and I don't want him to be labeled. My son mentioned to me going on medication.

I really don't want him to be medicated. I don't want him to have to deal with the side effects. I have family members that were on medication and it screwed them up. I take care of special needs people who are on medication, and it turns them into zombies. I don't want my son to go through any of that or end up being permanently disabled from going on medication.

I want my son to cope with his problems the best he can. I think he hasn't been trying his hardest in school. He's distracted by his laptop. I feel like he hasn't been trying hard enough to learn how to drive. He doesn't need medication to do these things, he just has to try harder and cope with what he has. I think medication should be a last resort. If he has truly tried his hardest, and still struggles then maybe he could try medication.

She really wants to have kids, I don't want kids at all. Both of our views are not up for debate, no convincing us otherwise. Just recently, we had an argument about vaccines. She said she doesnt plan on getting our kids vaccinated (I say ""our"" because she is still convinced that my mind on children will change, it won't). Even though I don't want kids, this struck a nerve. I said that was stupid. So an argument happened. Her mom is staying with us for a few days and she chimed in, ""pray in the name of jesus and your kids won't get sick"", my fiance' agreed. Queue eyeroll from me.

252,8k7jle,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k7jle/my_gf_is_getting_increasingly_impatient_to_move/,My gf is getting increasingly impatient to move in together but...,"So me \(33/m\) and my gf \(26/f\) have been dating for about 3.5 years and are more than ready to move in together. She has her own place but she'll spend the weekends with me at my place and ultimately prefers to stay there when possible. She has grown more and more frustrated with her place as it has limitations and rules from her landlord \(no guests, candle/diffuser/fragrances, laundry curfews and so on...\). The source of her irritation also stems from the fact that she is has to ""live out of a bag"" which is a valid point considering the best option is to stay at my place when needed whereas I don't have to deal with that issue.

This leads me to my main concern about our next step. To begin, I am *extremely* lucky, grateful and privileged because my dad sold his other house and wants to essentially invest and gift me with my own 3 bedroom condo. He has already sold the house and as of now currently looking at options that popup on the market. I want us to move in together into whatever property we get and suggested she doesn't pay any rent because she has a large amount of student loans and this would be a great financial opportunity to direct her income to the loans and wipe out her debt. She has her own insecurities about this process which is understandable because the context of this situation differs from, say, moving in together into a regular apartment where it's a 50/50 split and more of *our* place rather than *my* place that she feels she's not technically apart of. I tried to emphasis with her this will be our place because it'll be the next phase in our relationship but I do I understand her side of things.

With that said, we have been going to open houses and feeling out a lot of different places and she is incredibly excited to finally move in together and call a place home for us rather than the back and forth she's been accustomed to. This has lead to some minor tension in our perspectives and expectations going forward because visiting these condominiums on the market is fun but it's heavily emotional determining what we like and how we see ourselves in a new home together. I feel as though she has a tendency to get ahead of herself because she's so eager/excited \(also hates her place...\) that she liked the very first open house we attended and would've move in if given the chance. As of today we have seen about 8 different places and the most recent one was something she really liked \(me too\) and I suggested it to my dad. He's very calculated and smart with his investments and considering the magnitude of the situation so there is obviously a timely process that's necessary before taking any impulse action for what will be a huge asset in life. This brings me to my girlfriend...she has been getting impatient with her place and feels as though if we don't act on these great places we see then we will never get a place or it'll be years before we find something and it comes off as a little dramatic. She sees this way because the current situation is favorable for me since I have the apartment that she goes to while her apartment is less than ideal so in her mind there's no incentive for me to rush into a new property. 

I try to convey that I am more than anxious to find a new place together but considering the sheer privilege and opportunity that's bestowed upon us there needs to be a better understanding as to what my dad is offering and also the slow, thorough legal process needed to evaluate a potential place. In that regard, the last place we saw we both really like but my dad wanted to mull over a lot of research and she got the idea he wasn't too impressed which greatly discouraged her. This in turn lead to her suggesting she just find another apartment since she's growing impatient with her current place and it turned into an argument about this open\-ended timeline \(we've been looking for 3months so far\) about moving in together is since it's anyone's guess when/if other great options we like will pop up on the market again.

There's this girl I've known my entire life(14 years YES I know I am a bit too young for this whole dating thing). When we were kids we often played together because our parents have been friends since college but after a few years they didn't come that often anymore. She started school a year before me so that means she is the same age as me but a grade higher. Then one time when she finally did come over once again three years ago I noticed how truly beautiful she was. Five months ago we went skiing together and we talked a little bit about school and such. We got along really well but then the day ended and I felt really sad and empty because I knew that I wouldn't be able to talk to her for a long time again.

So the thing is I told a friend about her and he promised me not to tell anyone. You can imagine what happened in the next few days. Also he was teasing her all the time so I built up the courage to go and talk to her about this and if I should help her with that. Then my 'friend' came around, heard that I was talking about him, jumped into the conversation and my crush told me that that was weird and left. I don't know how he did it but afterwards he became friends with her and started talking frequently. Now I think that she knows everything.

I'd love to spend time with her again, it doesn't even have to be in a boyfriend girlfriend kinda way (that would be a bit of a problem anyways because in our age these so called 'relationships' don't last that long and if our families get invited to each others homes it'd get very awkward). It's just fun talking to her. I get this warm feeling all over my body and just smile although I never smile. 

So, the thing is, I have no idea what to do. I just can't get her out of my head. I also don't want to fuck this whole thing up so we will never talk again. Recently I added her on Snapchat and she added me back too, I guess that's a good thing. But I already sent her two snaps and she didn't answer to either of them. Please just help me in this situation!

**tl;dr:** I want to be friends with my crush which is my childhood friend but I don't know how I can establish that.

Yours,

Needless to say not being with  her for 2 years is really bringing me down.

She said she  still wanted to visit me some time later though.

Is  this relationship already dead before it even had a chance? Is there a  possibility of it reigniting if she does get a study place here in 2  years?

And how should I respond?,"So this girl and I have been talking since February, spending a lot of time together and going on dates and such. She just got out of a 4 year long relationship in January, so on our first date she told me she wasn't ready for something serious. But the following week she started contacting me daily, wanting to either chat or spend time together. This lasted about a month. So right off the bat, her words did not seem to agree with her actions... She told me she wasn't ready for something serious, yet she wanted to spend a lot of time together (nearly every day); it was as if we were a couple.

However, the last several weeks she has backed off a lot. She has stopped initiating contact; she's still responsive when I contact her, but she keeps it short. The reason she gave me was that she was super busy with school and such, which I knew was true to some extent. I tried to make plans with her a week ago, but she had to cancel due to a sickness. She told me, however, that she's really been missing me and wishes she could have seen me more these last few weeks had her life not been so crazy. Despite saying that, she still has not initiated anything since then. 

So again, her words aren't agreeing with her actions. She said she's missing me, but doesn't seem to show any interest in what's going on in my life. We're away from each other now, so I won't be able to make plans with her for a good while.

I don't quite want to give up on her yet, but how do I respond to all this confusion? Should I just give her space and be patient?

He told me, writing with me is boring and he doesn't want to write with me anymore because there is nothing interesting in our conversations. He told me it is my fault that he is bored when we are communicating. I He imitated me and began making questions like: what is your problem? What a dumb question \(when i asked if he wanted to stop writing or not\),  what an uncessessary question etc. I told him that I want to try writing about more than just general things but he went on saying that he understands from this that we will still be chatting about the same lame things like having a stick in the a\*\*.

Next day he told me he is sorry and that he would like to meet saturday, and said that he felt hurt and wanted to act cold. 

That wasn't the first time, that he acted like this and I am afraid that this could happen again. I dont know what to do.

I had suspected my boyfriend of sexting from a few months in. I had been out of town and the only way to contact one another was through facebook (which I don't like checking in a relationship as I feel it fuels insecurity). One girl had been posting about being roommates with him (news to me) and when I looked at her pictures he had commented on them saying things like nice tits.

We had extensive talks (as he had been eye fucking girls in front of me - just like the meme, followed over 200 nude models on - some of which I had suspected sexting) it took a couple months of me expressing my boundaries, and us talking about what we could both offer, before things started to improve.

Then we moved in together, and I started getting suspicious again, he would go through periods of not wanting to cuddle, or have sex (and I am a very sexual person so this is important to me). He eventually left up an email and I saw his password and checked his instagram. There was a message to a girl he used to hook up with inviting him to come visit her, and him declining, he didn't say why but she said 'oh your girlfriend won't let you'.

I pressed the issue and it came out that he had been sexting girls throughout our relationship, including co-workers who had known about me.

I am still waiting to find a place, and we have had lots of talks, he wants to make it work, moving forward with transparency, but for me to move forward I would want to recover his deleted messages and see the extent of the betrayal.

He is refusing to do this, and thinks it is unacceptable of me to ask that. My logic is that I don't want any more surprises (although part of me thinks there might be more to it, seeing as how it took me pressing and pretending I knew more than I did for over a week to get the bulk of it). I have learned stuff about his past that explains some of his motives, but I still want to know all of it (I think there may have been some physical cheating possibly, or he may have sexted the same girls more than once). We've been talking for three weeks and he seems to think that is too much (even though most of it has been us hanging out and doing the fun stuff we used to do)

What do you guys think, is it unreasonable for me to want to see that if we are going to move forward as a couple?

Help!,"Obviously my story is a long these lines and I really need some sound, unbiased advice. Just so you know a little about me I was married for 12 years and have children with my ex. He was the only man I thought I'd ever love and it took me 3 years to fully get over him and it happened when I met my current bf and fell for him. He and I met on social media(the current bf). We talked for 2 months online and then one day we finally met up. At first I wasn't really into him. I was seeing other guys and my walls were still up. He relentlessly pursued me and slowly but surely I started spending all my time with him. He became my best friend. We have been together for 8 months now. Here is his back story...He was with his ex for 14 years; they have kids and they still live in the same house that they own together. Most of the time he sleeps at my house but I'd say once a week he sleeps home ""cause he misses his kids"". I knew they still lived together but again, I didnt care. I felt numb and figured id only date him a few weeks and move on like I did with 25 other guys over the 3 years that my ex husband and I had split up and felt nothing. In the beginning it was all fun but now things are changing. I spend more time crying then being happy but I really really love him. The problem is I know hes not iver his ex. He says they are unfixable because she cheated but in the beginning he slept with her a handful of times til I found out. I know ssome other stuff that his ex has told me as well like that he tells her he loves me but he still tells her he loves her too. I think he's gotten himself into a mess. I dont think I am just a rebound; I think maybe I was intended to be since she cheated and they were only separated 2 months when we me. But I think he genuinly, unintentionally fell for me and now he loves two women and he doesn't want her to move on and he doesn't want me to end it either. He also doesn't want to lose his house and he wants his kids in his everyday. I understand all that. I even understand him still loving her and loving me at the same time. But I don't know what to do anymore. This is killing me. We spend every night together except maybe once a week but he won't let that part of his life go. We have broken up several times and then gotten back together the next day cause we miss each other like crazy. But everything is getting worse and worse. The break ups are coming closer together and the days apart are becoming longer intervals. I know she wants him back. She fights for him constantly to be with her. He tells her no but that he doesnt want her to move on. When confronted by both she and I, he chooses me. It doesnt make sense. I dont want to give up and walk away but I dont know what else I could possibly do. He has become my whole world in the matter of a little over a half a year. I know he needs time away from her to get over her. They need to split their living situations but he says he refuses. It's like he wants us both. How can I make him chose me for once and for all? Or should I slow things down and not walk away entirely? Maybe start seeing someone else to level the playing field. Tell him lets not talk for a week and see if he misses me? Help me please.

Long post incoming, I apologize in advance. Also on a throwaway because we both reddit.

To lay some groundwork, my girlfriend and I have been dating since high school and we also went to college together. We were so in love in high school, and even through college, until I went abroad my senior year and she got really jealous and clingy on top of long distance already being difficult. After I graduated, I  moved across the country and we started doing long distance again. I've never cheated or even thought of it, but one day I caught her looking through my phone in the middle of the night and at that point I realized she didn't trust me at all. We had a long talk and decided that we were both going to put more effort into the relationship. After that, things were going a lot better, we were communicating more, our sex life was good and we were back in a good place. But then, after she graduated, she was really depressed and job searching wasn't going well for her and I think she was jealous of me and the success I've been having since graduation. I try to help her, but she thinks I'm taking pity on her or making fun of her. As you can probably tell, our sex life has been suffering from this. She is listless, uninterested, and honestly I hate to be the only one trying it makes me feel like she doesn't care about me at all. Fitness is a huge part of my life and it's never been a big thing for her, and I try to look my best for her and it's like she doesn't care at all. She's put on some weight \(which I actually don't mind\-she's a very attractive girl\) but it's hard for me to see her as sexy she's only wearing sweats and has greasy hair and doesn't ever shave when I visit.

Jump to this year \(2018\) she's found a job \(across the country from me, so we're still doing LDR\) and she seems to be doing well and I'm happy for her but I'm not sure if I can keep doing LDR. She seems to be taking a lot more care in her appearance, which I like but at the same time it seems like the posts on her social media aren't even for me anymore. I love her and I really really wanted things to work out \(she gets on well with my family, we have so much history together, we've been there for all of our bests and our worsts\), but at the same time I just think that our paths our going in different directions and neither of us know what to do about it. I hate this, I really do love her and I really want to try to work things out but I fear we've become such different people we don't even want the same things anymore. I want nothing but happiness for her, and I know she wants the best for me as well but I'm not sure if us being together is what that is.

Is it selfish of me to want to try to make things work? Sometimes I fear no one will love me the way she does. What if I'm giving up ""the one""? Some days I really feel like I just want to cut her out and start focusing on myself and living my best life since we're barely together anymore but other times, when we're together, and I hold her in my arms and I can feel her breath on my chest and she smells like home and everything I love and all her little quirks and the way she knows all the darkness inside me and she loves me even more for it. I think, who else is gonna love me like this? Is it selfish to think this way? I'm so confused and my brain hurts and I just need some advice. It's been eating me up inside for months and I don't know who to turn to

She has frequent depressive episodes, and asks for my attention which is starting to feel more unhealthy and unsustainable

As the title says I have been having some issues with my relationship for a while. Some background. We have been dating for almost a year and a half and we currently live together. We recently decided to move and so because of that I have to pick up more hours at work to cover the costs. I will say that this move is mostly her idea. We have been living upstairs in a master suite at her parents house.

She (let's call her Jane) is starting a new job next week but has been alone on and off for a few days for a couple weeks. Historically she has had some pretty bad depressive episodes when she's left alone.

I get home yesterday, and decide that I want to sit down and play video games for a few hours. I haven't had much time to myself with all the time I've been spending at work, and I needed some time to unwind and to take care of myself. I am a very independent person while Jane is not so much. So I really try and make an effort to give her ""attention"" more than I naturally would. I feel like I have done a pretty good job of this. I make an effort to check in with her throughout the day and talk to her when I get home, asking about her day and generally trying to not be a shitty boyfriend.

Anyway, I can tell she's not feeling the best, so I ask her what's going on and she says ""I'm fine nothings wrong"" etc. I take it at face value.

This morning I wake up early, and I'm spending some time on the computer eating breakfast and I see that shes really upset. I had headphones in so I couldn't hear her, but she had been trying to talk to me and was very upset, feeling like I was intentionally ignoring her (I was not). She said she feels like, ""I haven't been around even when I am home and that she was feeling down and really just needed some attention,""

I tried to be as sympathetic and listen as well as I could. I let her know that, ""I am sorry you're feeling that way. I wasn't intentionally ignoring you,"" etc. and gave her a little love. I have a hard time knowing what to say in these situations, because I want to listen and be supportive but I also don't want to let her beat down and me and blame me for everything, or to enable some of her actions which I feel are less than productive. I have been working on the whole, 'Women want a listening ear, men want solutions,"" idea. I tried my best to take this approach, and just understand her perspective when these things come up. I can certainly be defensive, so when she does blame me, I try to take a breath and shut my ego up before saying anything.

Anyway, if this situation had been a unique one, I would be more than sympathetic and understanding. We all have bad days and just need a little support. But these things seem to come up every month, often more (is that exceptionally frequently? I feel like it is). Before I started working while she had time off, I knew she was going to struggle again. She gets very depressed and has a hard time on her own. And this happens all the time. I am at the point where I don't know what to do. Jane suffers from depression / anxiety so I understand that she can't always help it, but every day she has been home she has just sat inside and done nothing. When I get home, I do my best to give her the attention and support she needs, but some days I have to take care of myself and be selfish. If I don't do this, things will just get worse.

So there are a few components that I need advice on. First of all, I feel like she doesn't really do a lot to help herself. I want to be supportive and caring, but when I hear her say things like, ""I just sat on the computer all day,"" and, ""I couldn't go out because there's nothing to do,"" I really start to feel like shes amplifying her own misery, like she isn't making an effort to help herself. As I said, I am a very independent person and really like to have alone time. I have no problem finding things to do on my own, so I don't know where to draw the line between normal desires for love and attention and unhealthy / overly dependent behavior. The second issue is that it seems like she really doesn't know how to be her own person. Leaving her alone is something I actively worry about, which I feel like I shouldn't have to. I already worry whether or not I am giving her enough attention, and when things get like this, it really starts to make me think that she is dependent on me in some ways that border on being unhealthy. She will say things like, ""I just need some attention,"" I can appreciate that when she feels down, she wants some love and care. We all do. But when these episodes happen as frequently as they do, I really start to feel like she is using me as a band aid for her own problems more than working to figure out things for herself.

We have talked about this before.

I got jealous of his friendship with another colleague of mine. We talked about it but it remained unresolved. Months later, my jealousy resurfaced & my gut tells me they're together. I don't know how to feel. [x-post from /r/relationships]","Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8k5agv/my_old_boss_36m_and_i_27f_got_into_a_sexual/). 

**TL;DR: I fell for my ex boss who I was in an open/poly relationship. Jealousy issues surfaced and turns out my gut instincts might be right about my colleague and him. I need advice on how to deal with it.**

I am going to apologize profusely right at the onset because this is going to be a long confusing post that devolves into a downward spiral. I am feeling very vulnerable right now. Gutted really. But I need to vent and I could do with some much needed advice. Anyway,

My \(then\) boss and I started hanging out a lot often about 8\-9 months ago. There was obvious chemistry because he had that aura that just reeled me in. And I am a young naive woman who's not used to such sudden excess attention. Things eventually escalated and we ended up together. I need to add at this instance that I knew what I was getting into because we had flirted around the topic of polyamory and that's when I'd bumped into his \(primary\) partner as well. My moral compass isn't the best but it knew that I was only accountable for my actions. Which is the reasoning I went with as I ended up sleeping with him. I also knew that the power equation between us was quite imbalanced because of our work dynamic. He's my boss, I'm his junior. I'm adding all of this because rationally speaking my brain was telling me how bad an idea it was but I was consumed by the idea of being with him \(which again is how skewed power dynamics work\).

Cut to about December last year, things dialled down a bit. I'd been with him about 2 months by then. I also realized I was falling for him. I've to confess for all my lack of moral fibre talk that I give myself, I'm a needy sponge and he was fulfilling this really new aspect of myself that involved fetishistic sex. The power dynamic, the so called poly aspect of our fling and the BDSM just propelled me further into the deep end of affections.

But December was also when we had a party that changed a lot of things. Broke some part of the mirage. My colleague \[29F\] who was his desk partner started hanging out with him a bit more. His effect on me was such that I felt the first pangs of jealousy. It wouldn't have been an issue for me if not for the proximity of the act as it was unfolding at work. Plus she and I were close. I realized my zealous crush was what had pushed them together.

So she and I are at a party hosted by him and I realize I'm so new to social behaviors that I was an awkward klutz while she, who I thought had this lovely cutesy clumsiness about her, was a charming persona at the party. This is my first job and that means I am unused to social customs while she's been in the circuit for a while. I was failing at simple things like how to pour wine properly to behaving in an intimate setting. I've never properly recovered from that episode because he still calls me out on it in a way. And I went rushing to him because he was upset with my behavior on that particular night. I ran to him because our power dynamic by that time had ensured that I was slavish towards him. I just wanted to be on his right side. Even though my instincts were against it. I was also going through a very personal calamity around that time which definitely tilted a lot of the power balance to his side. My depression escalated and I lost all forms of self confidence.

Meanwhile, this party strengthened their bond a lot more somehow. They were texting each other more often and sharing stuff. I realized I couldn't be ""jealous"" because we had an open relationship thus voiding my emotions per se.

Though I did bring up the conversation once. I told him that I was feeling jealous of their friendship and I was trying to deal with it. In retrospect though, I don't remember him comforting me about it. I also said something on the lines of how I will deal with it myself.

But soon after after, things went from bad to worse that he decided to call time on our relationship. We lasted a month without each other. During the break, I was pining. I was having dream after dream involving him and I was consumed. They were so so harrowing that I remember waking up crying.

Another party happened and by some strange luck, we were both invited. Without getting into the details, we ended up together. But I also knew things were different because we had lost each other's trust by then. It oozed out in the ways we behaved with each other. We needed each other but we also couldn't stand each other. No extra conversation. The attention usually came my way when there was a need. Or if I had a need. We've trudged along thus till now.

\(Further context, he and his primary partner decided to part ways in the meanwhile. I realized I was a bit relieved but also very scared because i didn't know if bringing another person so soon was something I was comfortable with. It meant we needed to have a conversation soon. Also because one day post sex, he mentioned if I wanted to try couple swapping \(something I haven't indulged in yet and it feels like something that primary partners do\)\).

Then Tuesday happens. I'm walking over to my colleague's desk when I see her smiling at her phone. I also obviously see the name on the screen. It's him. And some red fucking balloon of anger pops in my head. I am seething and I'm unable to chalk it up to a hormonal imbalance this time.

Today, in my zealous jealousy, I snoop a bit because I'm over my head about this and I needed some answers somehow. And it's a tiny link. That's all. A link that's like a quiz about sexual proclivities that they've shared with each other. It's very intimate. It's questions like ""will X be woken up with oral sex by Y"". And I'm devastated. I am so devastated because I am not this snooping person but I have devolved into such a trash human being because we don't have trust.

I'm also fucking pissed because my survival in an industry seems fucking tied up to him. He's a big persona and I am screwed if I confront him. BUT I don't want to be so tied down and I just want some answers. I want to talk to them both because I will only combust if I keep this within me. I think I plan on asking my colleague first. Tomorrow. And then talking to him because I think I need a resolution. My work my life all hangs by a thread right now.

Am I doing the right thing? Am I being stupid? Should I quit the industry and just vanish? What do I do? I don't know what I intend to ask you all really. I just needed to fess up because I fear I will do something like self harm. But I'm not that person.

I am so heartbroken because I seem to be in a time loop of bad choices one after the one when it comes to men. I'm beginning to feel like I have a serious lack within me. And it's prompting me to reassess my entire existence.","['old', 'boss', '36_m', '27_f', 'get', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'get', 'jealous', 'friendship', 'colleague', 'talk', 'remain', 'unresolved', 'month', 'later', 'jealousy', 'resurface', 'gut', 'tell', 'know', 'feel', 'x', 'post', '/r', 'relationship', 'original', 'post', 'https', '//www.reddit.com', 'r', 'relationship', 'comments/8k5agv', 'my_old_boss_36_m_and_i_27_f_got_into_a_sexual/', 'tl;dr', 'fall', 'ex', 'boss', 'open', 'poly', 'relationship', 'jealousy', 'issue', 'surface', 'turn', 'gut', 'instinct', 'right', 'colleague', 'need', 'advice', 'deal', 'go', 'apologize', 'profusely', 'right', 'onset', 'go', 'long', 'confusing', 'post', 'devolve', 'downward', 'spiral', 'feel', 'vulnerable', 'right', 'gutte', 'need', 'vent', 'need', 'advice', 'boss', 'start', 'hang', 'lot', '8', '-9', 'month', 'ago', 'obvious', 'chemistry', 'aura', 'reel', 'young', 'naive', 'woman', 'sudden', 'excess', 'attention', 'thing', 'eventually', 'escalate', 'end', 'need', 'add', 'instance', 'know', 'get', 'flirt', 'topic', 'polyamory', 'bump', 'primary', 'partner', 'moral', 'compass', 'good', 'know', 'accountable', 'action', 'reasoning', 'go', 'end', 'sleep', 'know', 'power', 'equation', 'imbalanced', 'work', 'dynamic', 'boss', 'junior', 'add', 'rationally', 'speak', 'brain', 'tell', 'bad', 'idea', 'consume', 'idea', 'skewed', 'power', 'dynamic', 'work', 'cut', 'december', 'year', 'thing', 'dial', 'bit', '2', 'month', 'realize', 'fall', 'confess', 'lack', 'moral', 'fibre', 'talk', 'needy', 'sponge', 'fulfil', 'new', 'aspect', 'involve', 'fetishistic', 'sex', 'power', 'dynamic', 'call', 'poly', 'aspect', 'fling', 'bdsm', 'propel', 'deep', 'end', 'affection', 'december', 'party', 'change', 'lot', 'thing', 'break', 'mirage', 'colleague', '29_f', 'desk', 'partner', 'start', 'hang', 'bit', 'effect', 'feel', 'pang', 'jealousy', 'issue', 'proximity', 'act', 'unfold', 'work', 'plus', 'close', 'realize', 'zealous', 'crush', 'push', 'party', 'host', 'realize', 'new', 'social', 'behavior', 'awkward', 'klutz', 'think', 'lovely', 'cutesy', 'clumsiness', 'charming', 'persona', 'party', 'job', 'mean', 'unused', 'social', 'custom', 'circuit', 'fail', 'simple', 'thing', 'like', 'pour', 'wine', 'properly', 'behave', 'intimate', 'setting', 'properly', 'recover', 'episode', 'call', 'way', 'go', 'rush', 'upset', 'behavior', 'particular', 'night', 'run', 'power', 'dynamic', 'time', 'ensure', 'slavish', 'want', 'right', 'instinct', 'go', 'personal', 'calamity', 'time', 'definitely', 'tilt', 'lot', 'power', 'balance', 'depression', 'escalate', 'lose', 'form', 'self', 'confidence', 'party', 'strengthen', 'bond', 'lot', 'texte', 'share', 'stuff', 'realize', 'jealous', 'open', 'relationship', 'void', 'emotion', 'se', 'bring', 'conversation', 'tell', 'feel', 'jealous', 'friendship', 'try', 'deal', 'retrospect', 'remember', 'comfort', 'say', 'line', 'deal', 'soon', 'thing', 'go', 'bad', 'bad', 'decide', 'time', 'relationship', 'last', 'month', 'break', 'pine', 'have', 'dream', 'dream', 'involve', 'consume', 'harrowing', 'remember', 'wake', 'cry', 'party', 'happen', 'strange', 'luck', 'invite', 'get', 'detail', 'end', 'know', 'thing', 'different', 'lose', 'trust', 'ooze', 'way', 'behave', 'need', 'stand', 'extra', 'conversation', 'attention', 'usually', 'come', 'way', 'need', 'need', 'trudge', 'till', 'context', 'primary', 'partner', 'decide', 'way', 'realize', 'bit', 'relieved', 'scared', 'know', 'bring', 'person', 'soon', 'comfortable', 'mean', 'need', 'conversation', 'soon', 'day', 'post', 'sex', 'mention', 'want', 'try', 'couple', 'swap', 'indulge', 'feel', 'like', 'primary', 'partner', 'tuesday', 'happen', 'walk', 'colleague', 'desk', 'smile', 'phone', 'obviously', 'screen', 'red', 'fucking', 'balloon', 'anger', 'pop', 'head', 'seethe', 'unable', 'chalk', 'hormonal', 'imbalance', 'time', 'today', 'zealous', 'jealousy', 'snoop', 'bit', 'head', 'need', 'answer', 'tiny', 'link', 'link', 'like', 'quiz', 'sexual', 'proclivity', 'share', 'intimate', 'question', 'like', 'x', 'wake', 'oral', 'sex', 'y', 'devastate', 'devastated', 'snoop', 'person', 'devolve', 'trash', 'human', 'trust', 'fuck', 'pissed', 'survival', 'industry', 'fuck', 'tie', 'big', 'persona', 'screw', 'confront', 'want', 'tie', 'want', 'answer', 'want', 'talk', 'combust', 'think', 'plan', 'ask', 'colleague', 'tomorrow', 'talk', 'think', 'need', 'resolution', 'work', 'life', 'hang', 'thread', 'right', 'right', 'thing', 'stupid', 'quit', 'industry', 'vanish', 'know', 'intend', 'ask', 'need', 'fess', 'fear', 'like', 'self', 'harm', 'person', 'heartbroken', 'time', 'loop', 'bad', 'choice', 'come', 'man', 'begin', 'feel', 'like', 'lack', 'prompt', 'reassess', 'entire', 'existence']"

I have told her long ago how I feel about him, and she acknowledges he has his issues but so does everyone. They brokeup for a period of time and she dated other people and had a bad tinder experience and was convinced after they wer supposed to be together, despite the fact that he lied to her about being arrested and being on meth for 10 months. 
Most recently, he got a DUI a few weeks ago and now she’s paying his court fees. 

I love my best friend, how can I learn to love her soon to be husband as well? I just want her to be happy, and I need to know how to can get over all the shittyness her fiancé has done.

The relationship is sexless, typical dead bedroom. I want to stay with her but she makes no attempt at initiating or even talking about sex. Even when I try to initiate it’s maybe a text back and forth before she changes the subject. Now we have done things in the past, or I should say I’VE done things. I’ve fingered her a couple times and eaten her out once but she has never advanced on me. At the beginning of the relationship she said she might be asexual but now that we’ve progressed she says she’s not. We’ve slept together twice but when I tried to initiate I got a no both times. I don’t want to overstep or make it seem like that’s all I’m after. I’ve tried time and time again to talk to her about it but she’s just not having any of it. It makes me feel bad that I’m paying for all the dates, doing all the driving, and doing all the sexual acts on her while getting nothing in return. This goes along with affection as well she never goes out of her way to show any kind of affection. This wouldn’t be a problem but I’m affectionate, and always have been. This is only my second relationship but both have been like this. Is it me? I have pretty bad self image issues as it is so the fact that I feel as if she doesn’t want me just makes it flair worse. It’s almost like I’m paying to be this persons pet and to do whatever the desire but my needs are being swept under the rug. The relationship is very much about her as she always is complaining to me but never cares to ask how I’m doing or feeling even though she’s knows I’m going through a lot.

So we've been dating about 2 months.  At the beginning everything was going well and we moved very fast.  Seemed like we were both into each other very quickly.  After about a month it seemed like she's backed away a bit and is settling into a normal relationship instead of the hyper infatuation that happens at the beginning of most relationships.

Problem is, I can't shake the feeling that her backing away is her distancing herself and like she's not into me anymore.    We talk all the time still.  I just can't convince myself that everything is OK.  I don't want to mention it to her because I don't want her to think I'm crazy.

I even feel weird posting this.

**I included a TL;DR but please, if you can, at least skim through the main post, i really cant express how i actually feel in a TLDR that much**

Ill TRY to make this as brief as possible.

Ive probably had the feelings themselves for longer than that, but since i realized i liked her its been about a year and a half. Weve been friends for around 8 years now, basically best friends, effectively grew up together despite some literal distance. I developed a really bad anxiety problem when I found out i liked her, and it brought out things like self\-confidence issues. I felt even worse knowing what the answer would be if I asked her out because at the time she never really felt anything for anyone and even if she did it wasn't me. Her being my best friend, I naturally went to her for help and she helped through a lot of it. I did end up confessing because i just couldn't hold it in at some point but nothing came of it. If anything it just made us drift because she didnt want the friendship to be as intimate as it was. I only found this out later \(and it didnt really help my issues\), but around the same time I realized i liked her, she started liking someone else for the first time. They started dating around 6 months ago and it was in all honesty one of the worst things ive ever been through. Caused us to drift a little because of how i felt

Fast forward to now and they broke up and she's absolutely devastated, going through the motions, talking about her worries and feelings to me. Im obviously there to listen because ive always put her ahead of myself, mostly at the expense of my own health, but the point is, i feel like its just a matter of time before I crack. Everything she says about her ex partner mirrors so much of what i felt back then and still feel just as intensely as i did at the beginning. I want more than anything to make her happy and for her to feel better, Im there for her to vent, to distract her and to give advice \(i at least know something about trying to cope with this sort of thing\), but it hurts me so much to hear any of it.

A ton of the worries she has are pretty much the same worries i have except for her its probably going to turn out okay, they want to stay friends and she sees them like a best friend, while for me it feels that these same exact worries are always the worst case scenario. I feel like \(to quote her worry\) 'just one of their \(her partner\) many friends and not special to them at all', I feel like Im always the last choice and there is always a replacement somewhere in her other friends, sometimes people she pretty much just met. The only acceptance ive had was that even if i could never be with her we'd be the best of friends and super close and like family, and it feels like we were until all the sudden i just started to feel neglected. I dont want to blame her but sometimes i feel like i dont even get an ounce back of what i put in, even as just a friend.. Because she's straight up asked me, she still knows, at least to a small extent, i dont think she knows just how much, that i still havent gotten over her and that i still feel this heartbreak and she says shes sorry and that she hopes i can move on while I sit there and have to give her advice that consists of nothing but basically 'dont be me' and 'do the things i cant.'

As for moving on, its not like i havent tried. I feel like ive done everything i could. From trying to just accept it, to cutting contact with her to at least an extent \(it just made me feel so so so much worse\), to getting other hobbies and meeting new people and new circles, to other really bad habits id rather not go into. And i still feel like i love her just as much, if not more.

Sorry, whoever reads this, I know its a giant garbled mess. I just dont really have any other way to coherently express any of this.

I dont know if Im being unfair, I dont know what to do, Im just worried that this is either gonna hurt me beyond repair or kill me","['19_m', 'have', 'alot', 'trouble', 'help', 'friend', '19_f', 'immense', 'feeling', 'break', 'tl;dr', 'good', 'friend', '7', '8', 'year', 'go', 'break', 'time', 'be', 'good', 'help', 'feeling', 'worry', 'talk', 'mirror', 'validate', 'hurt', 'bad', 'include', 'tl;dr', 'skim', 'main', 'post', 'not', 'express', 'actually', 'feel', 'tldr', 'ill', 'try', 'brief', 'possible', 'have', 'probably', 'feeling', 'long', 'realize', 'like', 'year', 'half', 'have', 'friend', '8', 'year', 'basically', 'good', 'friend', 'effectively', 'grow', 'despite', 'literal', 'distance', 'develop', 'bad', 'anxiety', 'problem', 'find', 'like', 'bring', 'thing', 'like', 'self', '-confidence', 'issue', 'feel', 'worse', 'know', 'answer', 'ask', 'time', 'feel', 'good', 'friend', 'naturally', 'go', 'help', 'help', 'lot', 'end', 'confess', 'hold', 'point', 'come', 'drift', 'not', 'want', 'friendship', 'intimate', 'find', 'later', 'not', 'help', 'issue', 'time', 'realize', 'like', 'start', 'like', 'time', 'start', 'date', '6', 'month', 'ago', 'honesty', 'bad', 'thing', 'have', 'cause', 'drift', 'little', 'feel', 'fast', 'forward', 'break', 'absolutely', 'devastate', 'go', 'motion', 'talk', 'worry', 'feeling', 'be', 'obviously', 'listen', 'have', 'ahead', 'expense', 'health', 'point', 'feel', 'like', 'matter', 'time', 'crack', 'say', 'ex', 'partner', 'mirror', 'feel', 'feel', 'intensely', 'beginning', 'want', 'happy', 'feel', 'well', 'be', 'vent', 'distract', 'advice', 'know', 'try', 'cope', 'sort', 'thing', 'hurt', 'hear', 'ton', 'worry', 'pretty', 'worry', 'probably', 'go', 'turn', 'okay', 'want', 'stay', 'friend', 'see', 'like', 'good', 'friend', 'feel', 'exact', 'worry', 'bad', 'case', 'scenario', 'feel', 'like', 'quote', 'worry', 'partner', 'friend', 'special', 'feel', 'like', 'be', 'choice', 'replacement', 'friend', 'people', 'pretty', 'meet', 'acceptance', 'have', 'good', 'friend', 'super', 'close', 'like', 'family', 'feel', 'like', 'sudden', 'start', 'feel', 'neglect', 'not', 'want', 'blame', 'feel', 'like', 'not', 'ounce', 'friend', 'straight', 'ask', 'know', 'small', 'extent', 'not', 'think', 'know', 'not', 'get', 'feel', 'heartbreak', 'say', 's', 'sorry', 'hope', 'sit', 'advice', 'consist', 'basically', 'not', 'thing', 'not', 'move', 'like', 'not', 'try', 'feel', 'like', 'have', 'try', 'accept', 'cut', 'contact', 'extent', 'feel', 'bad', 'get', 'hobby', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'new', 'circle', 'bad', 'habit', 'd', 'feel', 'like', 'love', 'sorry', 'read', 'know', 'giant', 'garble', 'mess', 'not', 'way', 'coherently', 'express', 'not', 'know', 'be', 'unfair', 'not', 'know', 'be', 'worry', 'go', 'to', 'hurt', 'repair', 'kill']"

Having never dated online or dicked around on Tinder, part of me is curious to see if I have any interesting interactions. Just in terms of communication, not actually finding sexual partners. (And let's be real, it's hard to feel opposed to a little extra interest or flattery. I acknowledge this, having never been approached IRL and only dated people after getting to know them as friends - mostly from school, as I spent most of my life in academia and have a PhD. Also am soft spoken with a serious demeanor, which doesn't help.) 

So, I have zero interest or motivation to cheat, and vice versa, hence would never act on the inclination. However, the curiosity to try something like Tinder is still there. Seems like a mild form of when people who settled down early and retroactively want more time/experiences first to party, screw around, and be uncommitted... Not sure what to do about this, other than to keep ignoring it.

285,8k5di6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k5di6/ending_relationship_with_verbally_abusive_mom/,Ending relationship with verbally abusive mom months before wedding,"My mom verbally and physically abused me as a young child, and has continued to verbally abuse as a young adult and still today. She can be very and nice and sweet when things are going her way and when things aren't ""stressful"". She has a very short temper and is very easily angered. Two weeks ago I confronted her about discussing personal family issues with my soon to be mother-in-law, and she got extremely angry and defensive and told me she could do whatever she wanted and that I was being so arrogant and nasty to her. Finally after 30-40 minutes of a verbally abusive tirade she admits she was wrong. The next week after watching and reading online about abusive parents, I got an idea that if I want to possibly repair our relationship I needed to close old wounds from my past childhood experience with her. I request that she write out an apology for the abuse when I was a child. 
I later found out from my step sister that he was resistant to write me the letter, and my step sister had to persuade her by saying ""it's not that she's saying your a bad mother, but that she wants you to apologize for some bad things that you did."". 
She ended up writing 5 things she was sorry about. I said thank you, and I could tell she didn't want to discuss anymore and tried desperately to talk about something else. I wasn't done with the discussion, and I wanted to lay out some ground rules for us to have a healthy relationship. She never even let me get to the list before getting extremely verbally abusive and threatening calling me ""a bitch, arrogant , to go to hell, that I need help, that I have a terrible attitude ""superior complex"", my arrogant voice made her want to throw up"" and the list goes on. She then said that she wasn't sorry at all for my childhood, and that I was delusional for thinking that I was abused. This goes on for 30-40 minutes. While this is going on, My heart is racing and the whole time I manage to remain calm and collected without bursting into tears. It brought me back to my childhood/high school/ young adult years.
I'm 25 now, and I no longer rely on her financially. She would always hold against me the fact that she helped pay for my rent and medical bills when for the first few years of college.
Now, my wedding is in 4 months. After her verbal abuse she tries to reason with me and get me to go to counseling with her. I had been to counseling with her as a child, and I never saw any real change. She doesn't think she is abusive.
Right now her and my fiancé parents are planning on taking over the expense of the wedding. We already sent out save the date invites. I want to end contact with her. I can't take her abuse anymore. We already paid the down payment for venue and catering. I'm willing to pay that back to my mom and my fiancé family. I found another venue for a lot cheaper. It is still really nice. I just want to have a ceremony and go out to eat with a few close friends and family.
I'm worried I'm going to inconvenience people who may have booked a flight or hotel, but the other venue is not available to same weekend that I put down for the save the dates.
In addition, my mom spent a lot of time with my fiancé mom and family. They see the nice/fake side of her. I'm worried that they might think badly of me for ending my relationship with my mom or try to convince my fiancé not to marry me. The later I feel like is probably unlikely, but it still concerns me. They are a very healthy and nice family (zero abuse). I don't want them to think that I'm a bad person for wanting to end the relationship with my mom.","['end', 'relationship', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'mom', 'month', 'wedding', 'mom', 'verbally', 'physically', 'abuse', 'young', 'child', 'continue', 'verbally', 'abuse', 'young', 'adult', 'today', 'nice', 'sweet', 'thing', 'go', 'way', 'thing', 'stressful', 'short', 'temper', 'easily', 'anger', 'week', 'ago', 'confront', 'discuss', 'personal', 'family', 'issue', 'soon', 'mother', 'law', 'get', 'extremely', 'angry', 'defensive', 'tell', 'want', 'arrogant', 'nasty', 'finally', '30', '40', 'minute', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'tirade', 'admit', 'wrong', 'week', 'watch', 'read', 'online', 'abusive', 'parent', 'get', 'idea', 'want', 'possibly', 'repair', 'relationship', 'need', 'close', 'old', 'wound', 'past', 'childhood', 'experience', 'request', 'write', 'apology', 'abuse', 'child', 'later', 'find', 'step', 'sister', 'resistant', 'write', 'letter', 'step', 'sister', 'persuade', 'say', 'say', 'bad', 'mother', 'want', 'apologize', 'bad', 'thing', 'end', 'write', '5', 'thing', 'sorry', 'say', 'thank', 'tell', 'want', 'discuss', 'anymore', 'try', 'desperately', 'talk', 'discussion', 'want', 'lay', 'ground', 'rule', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'let', 'list', 'get', 'extremely', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'threatening', 'call', 'bitch', 'arrogant', 'hell', 'need', 'help', 'terrible', 'attitude', 'superior', 'complex', 'arrogant', 'voice', 'want', 'throw', 'list', 'go', 'say', 'sorry', 'childhood', 'delusional', 'think', 'abuse', 'go', '30', '40', 'minute', 'go', 'heart', 'race', 'time', 'manage', 'remain', 'calm', 'collect', 'burst', 'tear', 'bring', 'childhood', 'high', 'school/', 'young', 'adult', 'year', '25', 'longer', 'rely', 'financially', 'hold', 'fact', 'help', 'pay', 'rent', 'medical', 'bill', 'year', 'college', 'wedding', '4', 'month', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'try', 'reason', 'counseling', 'counsel', 'child', 'see', 'real', 'change', 'think', 'abusive', 'right', 'fiancé', 'parent', 'plan', 'take', 'expense', 'wedding', 'send', 'save', 'date', 'invite', 'want', 'end', 'contact', 'abuse', 'anymore', 'pay', 'payment', 'venue', 'catering', 'willing', 'pay', 'mom', 'fiancé', 'family', 'find', 'venue', 'lot', 'cheap', 'nice', 'want', 'ceremony', 'eat', 'close', 'friend', 'family', 'worried', 'go', 'inconvenience', 'people', 'book', 'flight', 'hotel', 'venue', 'available', 'weekend', 'save', 'date', 'addition', 'mom', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'fiancé', 'mom', 'family', 'nice', 'fake', 'worried', 'think', 'badly', 'end', 'relationship', 'mom', 'try', 'convince', 'fiancé', 'marry', 'later', 'feel', 'like', 'probably', 'unlikely', 'concern', 'healthy', 'nice', 'family', 'zero', 'abuse', 'want', 'think', 'bad', 'person', 'want', 'end', 'relationship', 'mom']"

290,8k53n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k53n9/moved_out_how_can_i_understand_and_fix_undefined/,"Moved out, how can I understand and fix undefined problems?","My wife [28F] and I [28M] have been married for 7 years, together for 10. I’m currently moved out (yesterday was Day 1), because she feels as though I bring emotional pain and overall damage to our household, with our 2 kids, when I am there. 
We’ve been attending marital counseling for a couple months now, and I’ve been personally seeking counseling for a couple years (off and on). 

Some background, I am a veteran of 5 years that has been dialed in to have PTS, but recently as I was digging deeper, I found that I may have bipolar-2. My next step was to discuss this with my doc and counselor, but my wife having heard this, and asked what her thoughts were, was nothing short of “my life is incredible and everything is going well for me but he seems to be jealous of what I have and I hope he can be fixed”. 

The next day, I came home early from school because, I felt real low, after taking a test. When I arrived I found my wife waiting to talk to me, the conversation appeared to be from a  concerned place, about me having attachment disorder and her wanting me to seek help and stuff. I didn’t interrupt her, but when she was done I explained that I think I’d like to look into one thing at a time, bipolar being the first. 

This ended with her describing me as the cancer in her life that she needs to go away, get fixed and only then she could reconcile with. She pointed at our entire adult lives being a product of her. I took a couple things and left.

I come from 3 divorces households, watched many friends parents get divorced and in the navy watched many more get divorced. This is not an answer, but I don’t know how to navigate waters with a woman that has me to blame for everything, to the point where she claims that counseling is not anything she needs. Also this is my second time moving out; the first time being 2 years ago.

What I am not saying is that I don’t have any of these issues. I just don’t think her inflated claims are realistic or fair, but she always goes back to them, never with an example or explanation, to help me understand her feelings. “You just don’t get it, no matter how hard I try”, but to me her trying is just saying ^ 

Needless to say I’m kind of in a slump further than I was when I talked to my docs. But I appreciate straight shots, thank you.

tl;dr - Admitted to potentially having bipolar 2. Moved out because wife thinks my issues are to much for her to bear. Thinks all I do is attack her, bring down the family, and harm relationships with other people.

I brought this up to her and she says she is depressed and never feels like doing it. 

Before we got back together, she had been hanging out with this guy who had a thing for her and she knows it. When we get into a relationship again he was pretty angry and stopped talking to her but now they’re talking again. Recently she’s been hiding her phone from me, so I knew something is up. When she left the room I took a look (I know) at her phone and they have been sending heart emojis and he even sent a shirtless picture of himself to her. I’m upset but don’t want to admit to going through her phone behind her back. This guy makes me super uncomfortable and she won’t tell me when they hang out together because she’s afraid it’ll upset me. I’m sure she is not cheating on me and we both love each other but I feel like this guy is toxic to our relationship.

I also post about this person in the Twin Flames sub Reddit because of the whirlwind of emotions that hit me when I first saw his tiny profile picture in the game. It was like looking at myself. I ""knew"" him immediately though we never met. We started playing a game and he said hi. I said hi back and he immediately started flirting. I'm married and I was honest about that when he asked me. I was 52, he was 48, single, never married.
He started in with I love you and ❤️ emojis within a couple of weeks of us meeting. We kept playing games. I fought off his ""lovebombing "" reminding him I was married. He would say ""Lynne, one day at a time. Just go about your normal life."" But he wore me down and I eventually told him I loved him from first sight. He tugged at my heartstrings, knew my marriage was crap. I was totally serious about him. I eventually told my husband about him too. And I told him I told my husband. 
For 2 years, he couldn't come meet me. He was insecure about his weight (around 375). I told him I loved him no matter what he weighed. We never did meet and I broke it off last summer.
He asked me for money twice. He was really who he said he was (not a full on catfish). I didn't sent the amount he wanted but I did send a few gift cards for birthday and Christmas.
My question is, who was in the wrong here? Should I have gone to see him, being the married one? Or should he have come to see me since he had less to lose than I did. Well yeah, his heart may have been on the line but then so was mine.

In short, I'm depressed, anxious and slowly losing my grip on my reality. I don't expect him to fix any of this or even know what to say. I just wished he'd show he cares more. I told him I'm considering dropping out of uni and he just asked what am I going to do, what is going to be best for me... Nothing about how I feel or why I feel it, I tell him I'm not even eating much any more and his response was ':/ sleepy snuggles will fix this'... I tell him all of this and let him know, and he doesn't follow up at all. The next day, he won't ask me how I'm feeling, if I want to talk, nothing... I don't really get the feeling of him being there for me. 

It's just, not sympathetic or meaningful, like I'm chatting to some random buddy about petty shit that doesn't matter. Like dropping out of uni, not eating, having suicidal thoughts and shit isn't grounds enough for him just asking me if I want to talk to show he cares.

Originally there were 6 girls planning to go and most have dropped out because of work commitments. So my good friend ‘A’ begged me to come, said she would only go if I did and talked me into it. I was unsure about going because I’ve never been away from my kids longer than overnight, but she insisted it would be good for me to have a break and we would have a lot of fun. She reminded me to get my passport, was texting me about how excited she was. So I agreed and made sure it was ok with my husband, I’ve paid for my flights and accommodation and so did she. Everything is all arranged and we fly out next month. 

Now A has backed out because she is having a lot of issues with anxiety and told me she definitely isn’t going now because she’s worried she will have a panic attack while we are away. Her husband is a little possessive too so I think that was a major part of her decision, he was never happy about her going. 

I know she has anxiety and I’m trying to be supportive but I’m mad that she persuaded me to go and backed out like this. Ordinarily I wouldn’t mind but since everybody else has cancelled too, it will only be me, the bride and her best friend sharing a villa and I feel awkward. I know the bride well and she is lovely, but I’ve never met the best friend and now I hear that the best friend is very confrontational and quite aggressive when she’s had a drink. 

If i don’t go I will lose all the money I paid for flights, accommodation and my passport plus the money I’ve spent on clothes etc. Also I don’t want to let the bride down as she’s already disappointed that everyone else has cancelled and she’s excited that I’m coming. 

TLDR: good friend backed out of a holiday she persuaded me to go on, and I will lose all my money if I don’t go

Any advice?

I’ve decided to still go and I’m meeting with the bride and her best friend next week for drinks and shopping so I can get to know the other girl more. I’m not shy and am pretty easy going and easy to talk to so I’m sure we will get along fine. All of your responses were supportive and I feel much better about going! So now I’m excited to visit Spain and have a 3 day break for the first time in over ten years! Maybe I will update afterwards. Thank you again!

So I’ve(25f) been dating my boyfriend(27m) for about a two and a half years. We live together, we have a dog. We are very much in a serious relationship and we both openly discuss the very likely possibility of ending up together. I love him so much, I don’t think I’ve ever met a person truly as good as him. We have a strong relationship. We don’t fight frequently, but when we do we always manage to talk it through without saying mean or hurtful things. It’s easy, but in a good way. It’s comfortable and I truly hope we do end up together. His name is Tim btw. 

So Tim, as long as I’ve known him, has been quite the drinker. We used to frequently go out in a large group three or four nights a week, all normally getting pretty drunk. I partook as well, I had the mindset that we are young! You only live once! Go out while you can! While not really thinking of the bad habits I was setting up for my future. Being drunk every night of the week certainly wasn’t helping any aspects of my life(heath, weight, productivity), so I stopped. Cold turkey about a year ago. I’ll still have a few drinks here and there but I’m not going to get blitzed on a Tuesday night alone in my apartment for no reason. 

Tim, unfortunately will. If I weren’t there I think he would drink every night of the week. He makes really strong drinks and will just keep going until bedtime when he falls asleep, drink in hand. 

I love him more than anything, we’ve discussed the path he is going down and he knows where it leads. It scares him, but he still keeps drinking. What can I do to help? If anyone has been through something similar; is this a tough love situation? Should I suggest we stop drinking all together? I’m willing to do anything if it helps him.  We are in our 20s, I’ve always had the mindset that this is supposed to be the fun years. I’m worried that if he keeps going this way he won’t be able to undo it. I’m not going to leave him. He could be a full blown alcoholic and I’d still stay so that isn’t really an option for me. 

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated! TIA

I was fingering her down there to loosen her up and as I pulled out my finger I noticed faeces on it. She noticed my body language had changed and asked if I still wanted to continue to which I sheepishly said I wasn't sure. We went back to hand stuff and she said 'this isn't working' and ran off, when I tried to come to her she ran away from me. 

This morning she was frosty as I was leaving for work and wouldn't look me in the eye. I tried to phone her, message her etc but she ignored me until this afternoon.

I explained to her why I didn't want to continue and that it was to prevent embarrassment for both of us, as we have had problems with faeces during anal in the past. She said that I was selfish and that I was affecting her self esteem, that our sex life would never be the same and that she would never be able to relax around me during sex again. She also cancelled all our weekend plans

I understand that she was embarrassed but my intentions were to prevent further embarrassment and also, I suppose selfishly, I didn't want to get faeces all over me.

Am I right in thinking her behaviour is completely insane? I maybe could have handled the situation more sensitively but I was kind of panicking In the situation. She won't listen to anything I say, told me to 'fuck off' when I explained why I did what I did.

Please help.,"My bf (36) and I (27) have been dating for 2 years. He’s never been an affectionate kind of guy and I’ve told him that in passing before jokingly. I am naturally affectionate and I’ve always been that way towards him. I thought that maybe by showing him love he will one day return it. But he never initiates it. Even after a long day at work and he comes home, he doesn’t hug me when I used to do it all the time. I’m tired of trying. I don’t like this platonic relationship.

He was the first one to tell me he loved me. This was when we broke up a year ago and he was trying to get me back. That event was the only time he showed any true emotions towards me. Ever since then I’ve told him I loved him multiple times with no reply. I’ve stopped saying it even though I want to out of embarrassment.

When we meet with friends he’ll make sure to hug them when we see them and when we say goodbye. The other day we had dinner with our close friends and he hugged everyone but me. I reached out to get a hug but it’s like he takes me for granted. Don’t get me wrong he’s a really nice guy. For example, he’s told me he can cover rent if I wish to quit my job and want to try and take a break while looking for another one.

I’m a pretty easy going girl who doesn’t need gifts, anniversary dates or surprises. He doesn’t even do anything special for me and I’m okay with that. But am I being too sensitive?

I’ve had two family friends who I thought I was close with for my entire 20 years of life. In hindsight I’ve realised that they’re not as close with me as I am with them.

Backstory: all our mums went to uni together and so when they had three girls similar in age they made us all friends. I happened to be the black sheep. 

There have been quite a few moments where they didn’t care about my feelings, or they would forget about me, or just simply not care. Probably too many to list but for instance, they showed up to my 19th birthday 5 hours late, and I only knew they were going to be late after chasing them up all night via text. They showed up as I was ready to go home. 

Anyway, two years ago they slowly stopped seeing me or talking to me, whether out of laziness or lack of caring I don’t know. All updates I heard from them came through my mum. I figured I knew when I was wasn’t needed so I’ve mentally cut myself off. 

One of them is turning 21 and I’ve been invited to her birthday even though I haven’t seen her in almost a year. The last few birthdays I’ve been to I’ve been ignored by her, and by many of her other friends there. 

I really don’t want to go, but the only reason I would go is to keep the peace. My family is still close with her family, plus this girl can be a little dramatic and if I don’t go it’ll be a whole thing and I don’t want to sacrifice my mental health by fighting with her. It sounds silly but I do think there’s a good chance she’ll try to pick a fight. 

My mum also seems to think that it’s better to just forgive and forget because “that’s just how they are”. These girls’ mothers are also inconsiderate of my mum’s feelings but my mum puts up with it because “friendship” I guess?

Another side note: I wanted to bring my boyfriend of two years because I didn’t feel comfortable going alone, but apparently my friend is uncomfortable inviting and paying for someone she’s “never met”. They have met. At my birthday she was 5 hours late for. 

So my question is, do I suck it up and go to avoid a fight with her (and potentially my mum and the other friend), or do I stick to my guns and not go?","['toxic', 'friend', 'birthday', 'tl;dr', 'see', 'talk', 'friend', 'year', '21st', 'birthday', 'risk', 'fight', 'family', 'friend', 'think', 'close', 'entire', '20', 'year', 'life', 'hindsight', 'realise', 'close', 'backstory', 'mum', 'go', 'uni', 'girl', 'similar', 'age', 'friend', 'happen', 'black', 'sheep', 'moment', 'care', 'feeling', 'forget', 'simply', 'care', 'probably', 'list', 'instance', 'show', '19th', 'birthday', '5', 'hour', 'late', 'know', 'go', 'late', 'chase', 'night', 'text', 'show', 'ready', 'home', 'year', 'ago', 'slowly', 'stop', 'see', 'talk', 'laziness', 'lack', 'caring', 'know', 'update', 'hear', 'come', 'mum', 'figure', 'know', 'need', 'mentally', 'cut', 'turn', '21', 'invite', 'birthday', 'see', 'year', 'birthday', 'ignore', 'friend', 'want', 'reason', 'peace', 'family', 'close', 'family', 'plus', 'girl', 'little', 'dramatic', 'thing', 'want', 'sacrifice', 'mental', 'health', 'fight', 'sound', 'silly', 'think', 'good', 'chance', 'try', 'pick', 'fight', 'mum', 'think', 'well', 'forgive', 'forget', 'girl', 'mother', 'inconsiderate', 'mum', 'feeling', 'mum', 'put', 'friendship', 'guess', 'note', 'want', 'bring', 'boyfriend', 'year', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'go', 'apparently', 'friend', 'uncomfortable', 'inviting', 'pay', 'meet', 'meet', 'birthday', '5', 'hour', 'late', 'question', 'suck', 'avoid', 'fight', 'potentially', 'mum', 'friend', 'stick', 'gun']"

Well, it didn't go so great. I told him to act naturally with me in person to prevent looking suspicious/creepy, but he gave me a hug before he left as he couldn't stay long. The leader of the group was asking me questions about him and now I'm wondering if I should tell the truth to my parents so we can meet properly or make up another lie about how we met.

Two weeks ago, we had a major fight in which I said that I don't think I can stay in this relationship any longer and that I'm considering to break up. But the truth is, I only said that to hurt her in this moment. I was extremely pissed during the fight and was also under a lot of pressure because of my University final exams during this time, so I kinda lost control over myself. I know I'm a total dick for doing this, and I regret it very deeply. I apologized a thousand times to her.
This was the first time any one of us has ever expressed such threats during our relationship.

She was extremely hurt and cried a lot during our fight. She thought I was extremely serious about breaking up.
When I calmed down, I said that I didn't mean it and asked for a second chance. She said she doesn't know what to think now - but eventually, she also calmed down and things have gotten more peaceful since then.

However, ever since that fight happened, she seems to have lost a lot of her trust for me. Before this fight, our relationship was extremely passionate and loving. We expressed our love daily and always missed each other when we didn't have time to meet.
But now she seems more distant. She rarely reciprocates when I say ""I love you"" and when I say things like ""You're so cute"", she often replies with a simple ""aww"".

I asked her how she's feeling and she confirmed that she is still hurting because of the fight. She said that after the fight she started to think about how her life would be like if we broke up. She said that now sometimes she feels like she needs to get out of this relationship.
But then again, she also said that it's not too late yet and that she still loves me. That gives me hope.

So my question now is: What can I do to win her trust and her full love back? Should I simply give her time? Should I discuss the topic every once in a while to see if we're making progress and to see if there's anything I need to do differently? If so, how should I approach this topic?
Any other ideas?

My family have a history of talking about each other behind their backs and playing general family politics and power games for years on end. 

Some context:

My mum and uncle do not get along at all. Uncle has been violent towards mum in the past. I believe uncle has used social and physical intimidation to control my mum and her place in the family for years, possibly since they were kids. Mum is 55 and my uncle 52ish. Mum recently stopped all communication with uncle

Ok here goes

I have been staying at my grandma's for a while during the university semester because she told me she was going to sell her house. It's a nice house with a lot of history so I decided ok I will spend some time there.

Grandma is ok for a few days of me spending time there before things start to get ugly. She doesn't respect basic boundaries like ""grandma don't wake me up in the morning"". Normally I wouldn't care that much about being woken up in the morning but she will wake me up and then start off with something in a condescending tone ""traveller you told me you have an appointment so I woke you up because you can't wake yourself up"". When I specifically asked her not to. She basically cooks for me and does all kinds of things to make me look incompetent even when I ask her not to.

So I'm talking to grandma over the phone and she tells me that my aunt and uncle say I'm welcome at their house any time after I had an argument with mum.

I asked her why she told them about my argument and she said it was ""out of concern for me"". I say ok fair enough.

The next day I call uncle and we proceed to have a pretty low grade conversation, which essentially involves him asking questions like ""so what do you do each day"" in the same condescending tone my grandma uses, implying that going to university isn't really a reasonable answer with his tone, and yet leaving it an innocent question with his words. 

When I chose not to respond to that question he fabricates a reason for asking ""I was wondering if you wanted to catch up for a coffee"". Never in my life has my uncle individually asked me for a coffee. He hasn't rang me on the phone directly in at least 10 years, all communication has been indirect (through my grandma or cousin's etc.).

I tell him I'm pretty happy on the phone right now considering things are still a bit heated between him and my mum. I say I'd like to call sometime soon and he says ""nope it doesn't work over the phone. I can't see you"". I feel quite intimidated about boundaries with my uncle in person. Even over the phone I can hear his condescending tone regarding uni and indirect lines of questioning.

My grandma often says I do nothing with my time. Always making comments about getting out of bed late, not doing anything with my day etc. To be honest the moment I try to prove to them that i do stuff with my day/time I have lost because they really should just respect my position without me needing to show them that I am worthy of their respect, I won't get it either way.

For reference I am a computer science student at the best University in my country so it's not really worth trying to prove that I'm intelligent or anything to them if they pretend not to know it at this stage I'm not going to be heard by them.


Really the crux of all this is tone of voice and manipulation tactics. I have a very hard time communicating with my grandma and uncle because they basically say one thing with their words and another thing with their tone. It's difficult to put into words since it really is a body language tone of voice thing.

What ended up happening is my uncle said no he didn't want to have weekly calls with me if I wasn't happy to meet up with him in person. He also changed his ""invitation to his house"" once I asked him about it directly, he said he would have to check with the family and that it would be a special occasion, when the original indirect invitation was that I was welcome whenever.

When I told him via text I knew my grandma had talked to him and told him I was in therapy and ""having a hard time"" and ""having some very strange and rude conversations with family members"" (she actually said that last one to my step dad),  he said ""yes I talked to grandma out of concern for you"". Which is bullshit since he doesn't even have the will to call me once a week even when I call him.

This is a bit of a tapestry of my grandma and my uncle and their exploits and antics but I hope I have expressed myself clearly enough for this to resonate with people.","['21', 'male', 'speak', 'uncle', 'phone', 'recently', 'hostile', 'conversation', 'uncle', 'phone', 'family', 'history', 'talk', 'back', 'play', 'general', 'family', 'politic', 'power', 'game', 'year', 'end', 'context', 'mum', 'uncle', 'uncle', 'violent', 'mum', 'past', 'believe', 'uncle', 'social', 'physical', 'intimidation', 'control', 'mum', 'place', 'family', 'year', 'possibly', 'kid', 'mum', '55', 'uncle', '52ish', 'mum', 'recently', 'stop', 'communication', 'uncle', 'ok', 'go', 'stay', 'grandma', 'university', 'semester', 'tell', 'go', 'sell', 'house', 'nice', 'house', 'lot', 'history', 'decide', 'ok', 'spend', 'time', 'grandma', 'ok', 'day', 'spend', 'time', 'thing', 'start', 'ugly', 'respect', 'basic', 'boundary', 'like', 'grandma', 'wake', 'morning', 'normally', 'care', 'wake', 'morning', 'wake', 'start', 'condescending', 'tone', 'traveller', 'tell', 'appointment', 'wake', 'wake', 'specifically', 'ask', 'basically', 'cook', 'kind', 'thing', 'look', 'incompetent', 'ask', 'talk', 'grandma', 'phone', 'tell', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'welcome', 'house', 'time', 'argument', 'mum', 'ask', 'tell', 'argument', 'say', 'concern', 'ok', 'fair', 'day', 'uncle', 'proceed', 'pretty', 'low', 'grade', 'conversation', 'essentially', 'involve', 'ask', 'question', 'like', 'day', 'condescending', 'tone', 'grandma', 'use', 'imply', 'go', 'university', 'reasonable', 'answer', 'tone', 'leave', 'innocent', 'question', 'word', 'choose', 'respond', 'question', 'fabricate', 'reason', 'ask', 'wonder', 'want', 'catch', 'coffee', 'life', 'uncle', 'individually', 'ask', 'coffee', 'ring', 'phone', 'directly', '10', 'year', 'communication', 'indirect', 'grandma', 'cousin', 'etc', 'tell', 'pretty', 'happy', 'phone', 'right', 'consider', 'thing', 'bit', 'heated', 'mum', 'like', 'soon', 'say', 'nope', 'work', 'phone', 'feel', 'intimidate', 'boundary', 'uncle', 'person', 'phone', 'hear', 'condescending', 'tone', 'uni', 'indirect', 'line', 'questioning', 'grandma', 'say', 'time', 'make', 'comment', 'get', 'bed', 'late', 'day', 'etc', 'honest', 'moment', 'try', 'prove', 'stuff', 'day', 'time', 'lose', 'respect', 'position', 'need', 'worthy', 'respect', 'way', 'reference', 'computer', 'science', 'student', 'good', 'university', 'country', 'worth', 'try', 'prove', 'intelligent', 'pretend', 'know', 'stage', 'go', 'hear', 'crux', 'tone', 'voice', 'manipulation', 'tactic', 'hard', 'time', 'communicate', 'grandma', 'uncle', 'basically', 'thing', 'word', 'thing', 'tone', 'difficult', 'word', 'body', 'language', 'tone', 'voice', 'thing', 'end', 'happen', 'uncle', 'say', 'want', 'weekly', 'call', 'happy', 'meet', 'person', 'change', 'invitation', 'house', 'ask', 'directly', 'say', 'check', 'family', 'special', 'occasion', 'original', 'indirect', 'invitation', 'welcome', 'tell', 'text', 'know', 'grandma', 'talk', 'tell', 'therapy', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'have', 'strange', 'rude', 'conversation', 'family', 'member', 'actually', 'say', 'step', 'dad', 'say', 'yes', 'talk', 'grandma', 'concern', 'bullshit', 'week', 'bit', 'tapestry', 'grandma', 'uncle', 'exploit', 'antic', 'hope', 'express', 'clearly', 'resonate', 'people']"

I am 21M, she is 21F. We met at my new job and she is just amazing. We have practically everything in common from music to gaming to philosophies and opinions.

It sounds perfect right? I should ask her on a date and that should be the beginning of the rest of that relationship, well it isn't that simple (never is) because of one thing.

She has a boyfriend, and has had this boyfriend for 2 and a half years with no plans of breaking up.

Now I am not nefarious enough to scheme her out of a relationship, that is horrible and not something I would ever dream of doing, but things are made even more complicated by the following things, because it's these below that are making me feel like she likes me back:

* We have practically talked with each other non-stop since our first meeting 2 weeks ago.

* She always spends half her lunch break at work with me, whilst I am still working shift, with nobody else, every time, without fail

* She always waits for me to walk the shared road of our homes

* She said I inspired her to begin playing an instrument (beforehand she had absolutely no experience nor wanted to play)

* Invited to her home after only three days of knowing her (Been a couple more since. Nothing sexual/intimate. Just videos games and banter)

* She opened up to me about her anxiety and other issues after knowing me less than a week (she even mentions this, quote: ""I am not sure why I am telling you this....here I am, telling a guy I met only a week ago about my insecurities"")

* I will catch her looking at me whilst I work my shift (I work outside where she can see me) and when I look over her gaze darts away to something else. Every now and then we will catch each others attention and I will do a stupid little dance or something to make her laugh. 

These are the stand out moments to me that I have noticed that make me believe she may have an interest back, it's either that or she is just the nicest person on the planet, which I wouldn't rule out because she genuinely is so sweet and caring for everyone.

Below are some more things that she does but I am not really counting them as definitive evidence she likes me, maybe you will though:

* Practically instant reply on messenger, and if I do not reply she messages again to keep the conversation going.

* Constantly teasing me (in a friendly way).

* We went to see Infinity War together and she paid for my ticket, I had to bargain with her that I'd pay for the next movie.

* When we joke around in person, I'll make some friendly sarcastic remark or tease her in a friendly manner and she will just stare at me and half smile half glare.

* When I do my daily streams she will come by and drop love hearts, and stay for almost the entire stream dropping in love songs on the song request feature.

So as you can see I have a lot of things going through my head that give me hope but also of course at the same time she has a BF, and having a BF is a clear NO. She did say they were having a rough patch as he is away for 3 n a half months and she doesn't do well in long distance relationships, however she seems to really want to make it work with him (of course, it's been 2 years, and honestly I do not blame her in the slightest for that.)

The problem now is that I have become so accustomed to her, so used to her, so...I guess you could say infatuated with her that I now wake up and go to sleep thinking about her and everything I would do with her (non-sexual) if we were together, I find myself automatically checking to see if I have a new message from her and it's fucking my head up. I cannot focus on new things because my thoughts always resort back to her.

I am afraid if I were to tell her how I really feel she would be freaked out by me, and wish to not see me again. 

I can't just drop her (not that I want too) because I work with her, so I'd just see her at work all the time anyway. 

I want to make it clear that, yes, I am only 21 and that, yes, I am aware I have a long time to find other people, but having a relationship is very important to me, I am mocked by friends because of how high on my priorities a relationship is but I yearn for companionship, someone to live life with and this girl is, to me... 

absolutely perfect. 

However, as I have said, she has a BF, which is an automatic NO to any sort of ""Will you date me?"" question I throw her way, so I guess I need to give the obsession over her up, as much is it hurts to write that. 

How do I do it? What do I do? How do I forget something seemingly unforgettable? How do I see her as just a friend, and not someone I know I could love and care for wholeheartedly? 

**TL;DR:** Met a girl at work, absolutely perfect, she has a boyfriend of 2 years, I can't stop thinking about her.

315,8k3knn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k3knn/29m39f_girlfriend_is_distant_and_withdrawn_from/,[29/m][39/f] girlfriend is distant and withdrawn from relationship,"I honestly don't even know where to start so I will start from the beginning.

Last year she was my boss and going through a divorce while having a boyfriend at the time. We starting talking and finding we had so much in common and then thing one thing lead to another and we ended up fooling around and enjoying each others company. She ended up leaving the boyfriend for me and we ended up dating for a few months. 

Things went south and she ended up missing the ex boyfriend and started talking to him again. She was texting him almost daily and they were talking about missing each other and loving each other. She then lied to me and went to see him. After that things went more south and she broke up with me and ended up with him a week later. Go figure. 

We kept talking during this period and she realized she didnt love him due to his anger issues and outlook on life. (Suicidal and just generally anger and unhappy) She didnt want that in her life. 

She told me she still loved me and she was wrong and wanted me after all. She broke up with him immediately and we got back together. This was around October. Things have been amazing. We were great. She wanted me to move in with him in May when my lease was up. She has still been dealing with divorce and lawyer stuff. She is also dealing with fighting for custody of her son. 

Around a month ago when the lawyer came into the picture and right before i was going to move in she seemed slightly distant and asked me not to move in saying it was a bad idea because of the custody battle upcoming. I didnt handle it the best due to her also seeming distant. I didn’t get angry I just broke down. I found a place and have been staying there. 

Since then I have found out she is talking to that ex boyfriend again and missing him. She has also been calling him. I asked her about it and she said she needed someone to talk to who understands what she is going through. I have not been married or divorced or have any children. 

Over the last month or so she has been more distant. She claims i have been distant. I have withdrawn a little due to the fact I feel like any advances are met with her getting upset saying sex isnt on her mind because she is so stressed. I have tried being lovey I have tried being distant. I really dont know what to do. 

She tells me I dont talk to her anymore but every time i do she seems to get upset saying im adding more stress that she doesnt need. It seems she is talking to the ex as an outlet instead of me. 

I dont know what to do. I feel like everything I do is wrong. I want to believe she is just talking to the ex because he can understand what she is going through but after what happened last year I am so very scared of it happening again. 

On the side of sex. She teases and plays and seems to want it but if I make advances she seems to not be interested or distant. 

I guess im just hoping someone will tell me there is still hope and what I fear is only in my head and not going to repeat from last year. Some days shes lovely and seems herself other days she is distant and doesnt walk to tell me whats on her mind.

ps. the ""ex"" mentioned was the ex boyfriend the whole time. The soon to be ex husband is out of the picture less the custody battle. 

If anyone actually reads this, thank you.

I know that your partner should be like this anyway but I think that sometimes partners of people with mental illnesses can be forgotten about, it’s very hard for them too! I always think about how it would feel to see him in my position and it honestly feels heartbreaking to even think of him feeling the way I do some days. 

I want to do something nice for him but not like buy him a gift or something, I want to show him exactly how much I appreciate him always being there for me, he never passes judgement and he never questions my fears or insecurities, he only ever tries to help me understand why I feel a certain way, by just sitting and listening to me for as long as I need. He never makes me feel silly for crying for ‘no reason’ and he’s always there, day or night, to tell me that everything will be okay.

Should I respond?,"She was my best friend for about 8 years. But last year she cut me out cold without telling me why. After some stalking of her social media, piecing together some passive-aggressive statuses she'd written, I worked out she had found something online I'd written about her. Basically, it was on some ""friendship advice forum"" and I was asking for advice on why she kept pushing me away, ignoring my texts etc. I was frustrated with her and I may have written some things about her I shouldn't have. So then I wrote her a letter and posted a gift to her house, apologising for everything I said, telling her how much I appreciated her etc. She totally ignored it. Then a week later I saw her in town and I went up to her to say 'hi' but she blanked me like I didn't exist. So that was the end of our friendship.

It was really hard the first couple of months. I was crying lots and I kept blaming myself for everything, feeling super guilty. Now a year has passed and I've made a bunch of new friends and I can't say I've been missing her that much. I think about the memories with shared but I no longer feel I need her in my every day life.

But a few hours ago, I get an email from her. All she typed was my name and then a question mark, as if to say ""is this still your email address?/are you there?"".

I'm undecided on whether to reply or just ignore her like she ignored me? Maybe she's going through a hard time, maybe she needs to ask a question, or wants to make amends. I don't know.

We didn't have any real issues with our relationship and just seemed to be able to resolve everything.

Well, she is an opera singer student, and her whole life her dream was to go to Vienna to study and become an opera singer. She is a bit shy and not a go\-for\-it kind  of person, but I am and I helped her and encouraged her to go. I am an entrepreneur with a couple of businesses that are going pretty well that I could set up in a way that allowed me to work location free. We decided I would stay and set up my businesses and after that I would move to Vienna with her and support her on her career.

Well, she left for Vienna around July of last year. I've been supporting her both morally and financially, and I've visited several times. Last time I was with her, I spent two months in Vienna in December\-January. Now, I'm almost settled and my business is almost set up that it will allow me to move in with her around August\-September.

Well, a couple of weeks ago, she asked me for a short communication break because she had to figure out how to make peace with a mom issue she had been having for some time and that she needed time to think. Well, I accepted to give her some space and let her grow and know herself. Well, she started extending the communication break and I started to get worried. I requested that we talk and catch up, and during this catch up she says she had been having great experiences volunteering in events and meeting people \(which I am happy for\), but that she also met someone else. During this time she dated another guy who fell in love with her \(and she admitted she was kinda falling for him\).

I, understandably, reacted pretty heavily and was pretty affected. She says she stopped the dating and told the guy she needed to figure things out and that she was with me. From what she says, kissing was the most that happened between them, but the fact she actually fell for him is what hurts the most. Anyways, I am not about to give up this relationship so easy and we gave ourselves a week to digest our thoughts and talk about the next steps.

She said she went out with this guy cause she felt  somewhat lost, she felt that she hadn't dated many people because of me, that she wanted to live more, and that she didn't feel loved. Well, I realized it's partly my fault, I've been so focused with work and with setting everything up for my trans\-continent move, that I took her for granted and perhaps didn't pay the relationship enough attention.

Anyways, we'll definitively talk next week to see our next steps, but I don't want to have the talk through a screen, and if this 7\-year thing is going to end, then at least I want the satisfaction of knowing I did everything I could to save it, so I'm planning to fly there next week and surprise her \(cause she would say it would be a waste of money if I told her, she's very money conscious\), try to show her I still care and that I really am committed to fixing this.

Is this an over reaction? Should I talk to her beforehand?

I've been thinking about it for the past couple of days, and been missing a whole lot of sleep because of it.

Please, let me know what you guys think

TL;DR: I helped my gf of 7 years to move to Vienna to study her dream career. I was a couple of months away from moving there myself and supporting her. Now she's having doubts about our relationship and has been falling for someone else.

We’ve been dating for 5 months and have never had a fight. He kisses me and tells me I’m perfect all the time, he genuinely cares about my emotions (which is pretty rare to find in a guy?), he’s smart and in one year of knowing him, I can’t think of a single fault. I’m not even being blind, he’s just a really good guy who wants the best for me, even if it hurts him.

But the problem is, I’m not really attracted to him. He’s kind of short around 5”6, not the race I usually date (although he is fit) and physically not my type, so all the kissing/cuddling doesn’t give me any romantic or sexual fulfilment. I kind of reciprocate what he does, because that’s what I’m meant to do. Like I kiss him but I don’t feel anything. It almost feels gross because I hate saliva.

Basically I feel like I’m missing out on the sexual side. Depending on what he’s wearing, i can go from kinda attracted to repulsed. But he had a personality that no other guy can beat. I also know that if I broke up with him, he would respect my decision (which would make me feel even worse) but probably stop being friends because seeing me would hurt too much. And I would be heartbroken to lose him as a friend. 

Idk what to do so I’m asking anyone for advice. If we broke up, I’d lose the best man I will probably ever meet, but I can’t help but feel like I’m missing out on what other couples have, and what he has from me, because I’m not in love with him. Like I’ve never felt anything when we cuddle/kiss (I’ve felt more closeness from cuddling with female friends than him), but I know he loves it.

I keep hoping that he’ll reveal something about himself/his personality that I don’t like, so that if I do break up wth him some time down the track, I don’t feel like I gave up the perfect guy.

To make it worse, I’m in love with another guy who is hot and might like me, but is pretty shy, so I know he won’t show the same affection and emotional concern.

Tl;dr I’m dating a guy with the best personality in the world, but not physically attracted to him.

A little backstory is that we were in a long distance relationship and things got harder and harder. I have a hard time articulating why I wanted out, which made the break up even harder. She's a good person and I love her, (here comes the but) but she has a hard time talking about things and doing things. I'd be very open about what I want and need, Im not the kind of person who shies away from tough conversations, and she was always scared that I would fly off the handle or be upset. 

Not to paint her in a negative way but I legitimately didn't fly off the handle when she would express herself. She has a lot of past shit that leads her into her not feeling safe about talking about things, but it's been over a year. 

I didn't know how to show her beyond trying to empathize with the things she asked for  or try to show her that I wouldn't flip out if she made simple requests of me.

It may not seem like much but when we did get to see eachother I felt a lack of intimacy and sexual desire on her part, I get it, it can be difficult when you haven't seen someone for a while to just jump right back into things. I haven't felt lusted after, or like she was very into our sex. She assured me it was because a multitude of things, but it always felt like it was something.


Im trying to not condemn her or speak ill of her because I still love and respect her. However the break up was made very hard because she kept saying all the things she wished she had done and said etc, and I asked her why it takes us being at this point for her to want to say and do these things?

Basically because the relationship is regressing, I didn't want to continue to put the work in towards something that we didn't even have a concrete endgoal with, she doesn't want to move to where I am and vice versa, I respect her decision and she understands mine. 

We wanted to be together but things just got so stuck, I feel a lot of guilt, and like my reasoning ""isn't enough"" because she claims to be a bit blind sided by it. I don't want to put all the blame on her it was really hard for me to skype and so I didn't as much as I should have because it hurt me to see her and not be able to be in the same space as her.  

After talking it seems like a lot of the things I needed, she wouldn't do, or thought about doing  but then didn't. Now she's telling me these things and some of them legitimately shocked me because I didn't feel them from her.

I'd appreciate advice and gentle constructive criticism. When I talk to her I feel bad and like I made a mistake, but when I don't talk to her I feel a bit of relief.

We have been together for two years, and I left for Europe in January, with plans to come back to the states in June.My S/O made plans to visit me in June, then we would go home together.  On May 1st, I kissed another guy, and I told my S/O about it. He forgave me, and it was water under the bridge. Today he calls me up to tell me he had sex with someone. He said he didn't realize how much it affected him after I kissed someone else. When his friends joked I was getting some Italian sausage, it's actually something that came true and he felt some resentment toward me. There was a girl messaging him on Instagram, and he gave into her advances and invited her over where they proceeded to have sex. He said he made a mistake and I'm the person he wants to be with. Mind you, this is the person I thought I was going to spend my life with as soon as I got back to the states.

We dated for 9 years and we got married last year. We get along so well that we consider each other as best friends. We definitely had our ups and downs but we got past it each time. The biggest issue we had was communicating because it was hard for him to verbalize his feelings so I often felt the pressure to bring up fights or it was just left unsolved. After the third year he really tried to make it work by expressing himself more and it got so much better.

I’m not sure when it started but his feelings slowly changed. I can tell his sex drive was diminishing. He said it was because of his diet and kept reassuring me it has nothing to do with me. He didn’t listen as much. I’d tell him trips I would like to go on or things I’d like to do but it was spoken into the air and evaporated. I think over time I just ignored it and just enjoyed the things that we actually did do. We have a lot of fun together because we enjoy little things. I’m not exactly innocent either because I stopped doing cutesy things like writing him notes or giving him hand made gifts. I felt the distance growing in very tiny amounts but overlooked it as something minor that will get better with time.

2 weeks ago we got into a fight. I learned he had given his number out to a girl and I was so upset I didn’t talk to him for the day but he didn’t bring it up and we didn’t make up as quickly as we usually did. It dragged on for an entire 1.5 weeks until finally, I sucked it up and reached out to him. That’s when he told me he sees me more like his best friend than a lover. I think this was also the reason why he didn’t talk to me first, because he didn’t know how to verbalize it. I’m not sure how we reverted back to the same issue we thought we solved years ago about communicating. Af the same time, he said he couldn’t imagine being with someone else but he doesn’t know what to make of his feelings. He said he wouldn’t ever cheat on me and admit that he only gave out his number because he liked the attention. I asked him if he’s no longer in love with me but he said he doesn’t know. It makes me feel uneasy because he asks me things like, “if we ever separate do you think we would still be best friends”. Or, “do you think people change?”. I told him to reflect on his feelings and to let me know what it all means on Saturday whether he wants to make it work or not. He agreed but also said “what if I don’t ever figure it out” and “don’t you get scared that we might not work out”. 

Sigh, I have felt the distance but I didn’t think it would lead to this. I thought we’d figure a way to work it out but I’m laying here tonight crying, and just feeling so unsure of it all. I never felt so alone before. He doesn’t hug me at night anymore or reach for my hand.

I can’t help but wonder if it’s something I’m doing that contributes to it. I did gain weight over the years and don’t dress up as much as he does. Also, he said that he wished we were not such good friends when we first started talking to each other and that we should have just dated right off the bat instead so that he could sweep me off my feet. I told him that it’s never too late to sweep someone off their feet but he replied with, “you already know everything about me”. I’m a little confused as to how it relates.

My questions are:

- is this a normal funk in marriages where one person loses interest and can it get better? If so how can we make it work (considering he is willing)
- is it something I’m doing or something I’m not seeing?
- is it possible to fall back in love?

Any advice about anything would be greatly appreciated. 

 Sigh. Thank you for letting me share reddit.

I looked up if it was okay to argue over text, and most (if not all) sources told me not to do that. 
However, don’t different methods work for different couples?

Backstory: Things got heated between my boyfriend about some dead bedroom situations we’ve been having. I left the house super frustrated, and he texted me something so I responded. Before I knew it, we were texting back and forth about the previous topics. Instead of angry comments, we had a real discussion. I think keeping the face to face to a minimum and having a neutral dialogue really helped. I couldn’t convey any of his messages as angry, which I can do when we argue in front of each other. (Without the anger aspect, I found it’s very easy for me to respond to what he’s saying.) 

TLDR; I found out that texting my boyfriend during an argument helps me handle the topics of the argument better. 

Is this healthy? Should we try this more?

I knew I had to but I cannot seem to stop thinking that maybe I shouldn't have. Backstory: We had been seeing each other for about 5 months, off and on again because of timing, so we finally made it official a month ago--I know not that long ago--but it's weird because it felt like we were together by month 3. Anyways, I knew from the beginning that he had a tinder account and stated he only used it for friends. I just couldn't handle the intense anxiety I had because he was super protective of his phone from the day I met him. I guess I let my insanity get the best of me and I found text messages from girls and even pictures sent back and forth. I did it once before but stopped before getting any further because I got too scared. I'm sure I made the right decision, but he also sent me a long message explaining why he never could give me the affection I ""deserved"" and that he loves me but I deserve way better. I also just found out he blocked and unblocked me on instagram so I wasn't following him anymore. All of this is confusing, and I'm trying to tell myself that this is for the better but I'm just getting mixed signals because he seemed so angry that I was accusing him, even though I knew. Does he want me to feel guilty? Or does he actually hate me.","['f', '20', 'break', 'boyfriend', 'm', '20', 'unthinkable', 'snoop', 'break', 'boyfriend', 'know', 'stop', 'think', 'maybe', 'backstory', 'see', '5', 'month', 'timing', 'finally', 'official', 'month', 'ago', 'know', 'long', 'ago', 'weird', 'feel', 'like', 'month', '3', 'anyways', 'know', 'beginning', 'tinder', 'account', 'state', 'friend', 'handle', 'intense', 'anxiety', 'super', 'protective', 'phone', 'day', 'meet', 'guess', 'let', 'insanity', 'good', 'find', 'text', 'message', 'girl', 'picture', 'send', 'forth', 'stop', 'get', 'get', 'scared', 'sure', 'right', 'decision', 'send', 'long', 'message', 'explain', 'affection', 'deserve', 'love', 'deserve', 'way', 'well', 'find', 'block', 'unblock', 'instagram', 'follow', 'anymore', 'confusing', 'try', 'tell', 'well', 'get', 'mixed', 'signal', 'angry', 'accuse', 'know', 'want', 'feel', 'guilty', 'actually', 'hate']"

I’m a 20-something year old female finally feeling ready enough to start dating again after a break up a couple years ago, but at the same time I feel like I’ve learned so much about independence & being my own person, & the importance of this.
I’m wondering how anyone here maintains an independent self while also being in a romantic relationship. I don’t want to fall into that trap again where my world revolves around this one person, but rather, where I have many worlds & all equally contribute to my life & I can contribute to those worlds as well.
As far as having a relationship goes, don’t foresee it happening anytime soon, so maybe I’ll know the answer to this once I’m ready. But curious to hear people’s thoughts now.

330,8k2564,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k2564/i_31m_need_help_with_my_wifes_27f_anger_issues/,I [31M] need help with my wife's [27F] anger issues,"I have been married for a year now and things haven't been good from day 1. I think we got married for the wrong reasons. Long story short, I had commitment issues and she really wanted to get married. We broke up, I missed her. We got back together and I married her. I love her, but I love her less with every fight that we have. And I worry that it will soon be too late to fix our relationship. I'm pretty desperate and willing to try anything.

Typically we are pretty loving and caring and will call each other cute names and cuddle and watch tv and in bed and care for one another and kiss each other at every opportunity for no reason at all. But then when we fight, it feels absolutely awful. Each fight feels like it might be the end of our relationship.

Basically the way I see it is she has anger issues. She gets set off by small things like me making a mess in the kitchen, or me gasping when she stained our brand new couch, or me telling her the dinner she made is ""good"" and not ""very good."", or me trying to defend myself when she says I don't do anything romantic by giving her examples of things I do that one would consider romantic. To think of it, they usually spiral out of control once I start defending myself. They then snowball into a big fight and then she loses it and says things she doesn't mean, like ""GO TO HELL!"", ""FUCK YOU!"", ""GET LOST!"" and on two occasions she has physically hit me. I have never and will never hit her back. There have been so many episodes of uncontrolled anger \- on one occasion she was chopping vegetables and threw a knife on the floor which bounced but didn't hit anyone. I told her how unsafe that was and that I could have gotten hurt. Her response was that I was a selfish prick cause I only cared about myself because I didn't say she could have gotten hurt too. On another occasion she throw her phone into my chest. On yet another occasion she smashed her phone into the ground. I cannot deal with her anger. I have asked her to get help but she refuses to acknowledge she has a problem. She says that I make her do these things because of the things I say. The way I see it, I'm just defending myself or explaining myself when things escalate to these levels. I have tried remaining quiet, which works but I can't always stop myself from saying something, particularly when she's attacking me verbally and then it quickly spirals out of control. These fights used to happen once a week. Now they're about once a month. When she does apologise, she never apologises for a specific thing she did, which makes it seem like it's not a genuine apology. I think she blames me for her outbursts. After these fights she is ice cold to me for 1\-4 days but super nice to everyone else.

When I suggested couples counselling she thought I was giving up on us and she would have no part of it and she didn't want to talk to a stranger about our problems. To make matters worse, after these big fights where yells these awful things, she expects me to be loving and caring towards her as if nothing ever happened. We are just supposed to kiss and make up and cuddle. If I try talking about what happened after things have calmed down, it turns into a big fight again. I cannot just keep pretending like nothing ever happened. It drives me nuts.

Meanwhile she makes almost no effort in our relationship besides cooking, cleaning \(which I also do\) and buying me gifts. She has initiated sex a grand total of 2 times in our first year and a half together. I have initiated more times than I can count, only to be told she is ""too tired"" or ""it's too late"" or ""I'm not in the mood"", or ""my head hurts"". When I brought it up she says I am not romantic enough and she is not a sex robot. Another complaint she has is I only want to have sex in bed. She wants sex outside bed, but she never makes space for it. If I feel her up in the kitchen she shoos me away saying she's busy. If I start kissing her on the couch my weight is too much \(I'm 80kg and 6'0"" so not fat or anything\) or she says she's watching tv and I should too or says that I am not touching her ""in a romantic way"". None of my exes have ever had complaints about the way I initiate or touch them, but none of my other relationships have lasted that long either. Meanwhile she tells me one of the reasons we fight is we don't have sex and she can feel me up whenever she wants. If I resist she gets upset. If by some miracle we do have sex, my PE means I don't last long but I'm usually ready for round 2 in a few minutes but once I come she's immediately put off and has that look of disappointment on her face. I tried to talk to her about PE but she doesn't seem to believe that it's not really in my control. Before we got married I was able to make her come in minutes. Since we got married she hasn't been able to come at all even if we go at it for an hour. She also does not let me perform oral, maybe a self\-esteem thing but I haven't dug into it.

I could go on and on about our other issues but I guess these are the ones important to me. I am tired. Tired of trying to bend over backwards for her. Tired of trying to please her. Tired of feeling like I'm not good enough. I need help. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can talk to her without her getting really upset and blasting at me. I have tried telling her I don't feel safe when she yells at me or hits me which she calls ""bullshit."" I also have nobody to talk to about these fights. I cannot afford a therapist. I can't talk to friends about her as I don't want her relationship with them to be affected by this. To everyone else, we're the perfect loving couple but in reality we have a pretty dysfunctional relationship. I am starting to think she has BPD or NPD or a similar disorder. What can I do? Is there anything I can do to make things better?

**tl;dr:** My wife has anger issues. Our fights about small mundane things turn into huge fights where I am yelled at. She blames me for the way she reacts. We also don't have sex but she's both the one complaining and the one stopping us from having any. She won't seek professional help. I can't talk to anyone about this and I need help figuring out what to do.","['31_m', 'need', 'help', 'wife', '27_f', 'anger', 'issue', 'marry', 'year', 'thing', 'good', 'day', '1', 'think', 'get', 'marry', 'wrong', 'reason', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'commitment', 'issue', 'want', 'marry', 'break', 'miss', 'get', 'marry', 'love', 'love', 'fight', 'worry', 'soon', 'late', 'fix', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'desperate', 'willing', 'try', 'typically', 'pretty', 'loving', 'caring', 'cute', 'name', 'cuddle', 'watch', 'tv', 'bed', 'care', 'kiss', 'opportunity', 'reason', 'fight', 'feel', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'fight', 'feel', 'like', 'end', 'relationship', 'basically', 'way', 'anger', 'issue', 'get', 'set', 'small', 'thing', 'like', 'make', 'mess', 'kitchen', 'gasp', 'stain', 'brand', 'new', 'couch', 'tell', 'dinner', 'good', 'good', 'try', 'defend', 'say', 'romantic', 'give', 'example', 'thing', 'consider', 'romantic', 'think', 'usually', 'spiral', 'control', 'start', 'defend', 'snowball', 'big', 'fight', 'lose', 'say', 'thing', 'mean', 'like', 'hell', 'fuck', 'lose', 'occasion', 'physically', 'hit', 'hit', 'episode', 'uncontrolled', 'anger', 'occasion', 'chop', 'vegetable', 'throw', 'knife', 'floor', 'bounce', 'hit', 'tell', 'unsafe', 'get', 'hurt', 'response', 'selfish', 'prick', 'cause', 'care', 'get', 'hurt', 'occasion', 'throw', 'phone', 'chest', 'occasion', 'smash', 'phone', 'ground', 'deal', 'anger', 'ask', 'help', 'refuse', 'acknowledge', 'problem', 'say', 'thing', 'thing', 'way', 'defend', 'explain', 'thing', 'escalate', 'level', 'try', 'remain', 'quiet', 'work', 'stop', 'say', 'particularly', 'attack', 'verbally', 'quickly', 'spiral', 'control', 'fight', 'happen', 'week', 'month', 'apologise', 'apologise', 'specific', 'thing', 'make', 'like', 'genuine', 'apology', 'think', 'blame', 'outburst', 'fight', 'ice', 'cold', '1', '-4', 'day', 'sup', 'nice', 'suggest', 'couple', 'counsel', 'think', 'give', 'want', 'talk', 'stranger', 'problem', 'matter', 'bad', 'big', 'fight', 'yell', 'awful', 'thing', 'expect', 'love', 'care', 'happen', 'suppose', 'kiss', 'cuddle', 'try', 'talk', 'happen', 'thing', 'calm', 'turn', 'big', 'fight', 'pretend', 'like', 'happen', 'drive', 'nuts', 'make', 'effort', 'relationship', 'cooking', 'clean', 'buy', 'gift', 'initiate', 'sex', 'grand', 'total', '2', 'time', 'year', 'half', 'initiate', 'time', 'count', 'tell', 'tired', 'late', 'mood', 'head', 'hurt', 'bring', 'say', 'romantic', 'sex', 'robot', 'complaint', 'want', 'sex', 'bed', 'want', 'sex', 'outside', 'bed', 'make', 'space', 'feel', 'kitchen', 'shoo', 'away', 'say', 'busy', 'start', 'kiss', 'couch', 'weight', '80', 'kg', '60', 'fat', 'say', 'watch', 'tv', 'say', 'touch', 'romantic', 'way', 'ex', 'complaint', 'way', 'initiate', 'touch', 'relationship', 'last', 'long', 'tell', 'reason', 'fight', 'sex', 'feel', 'want', 'resist', 'get', 'upset', 'miracle', 'sex', 'pe', 'mean', 'long', 'usually', 'ready', 'round', '2', 'minute', 'come', 'immediately', 'look', 'disappointment', 'face', 'try', 'talk', 'pe', 'believe', 'control', 'get', 'married', 'able', 'come', 'minute', 'get', 'marry', 'able', 'come', 'hour', 'let', 'perform', 'oral', 'maybe', 'self', '-esteem', 'thing', 'dig', 'issue', 'guess', 'one', 'important', 'tired', 'tired', 'try', 'bend', 'backwards', 'tired', 'try', 'tired', 'feel', 'like', 'good', 'need', 'help', 'know', 'feel', 'like', 'talk', 'get', 'upset', 'blast', 'try', 'tell', 'feel', 'safe', 'yell', 'hit', 'call', 'bullshit', 'talk', 'fight', 'afford', 'therapist', 'talk', 'friend', 'want', 'relationship', 'affect', 'perfect', 'love', 'couple', 'reality', 'pretty', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'start', 'think', 'bpd', 'npd', 'similar', 'disorder', 'thing', 'well', 'tl;dr', 'wife', 'anger', 'issue', 'fight', 'small', 'mundane', 'thing', 'turn', 'huge', 'fight', 'yell', 'blame', 'way', 'react', 'sex', 'complaining', 'stop', 'have', 'seek', 'professional', 'help', 'talk', 'need', 'help', 'figure']"

I left to go visit family and we were FaceTiming and they were hanging out at her place (my bf’s brother was also there) and his brother was talking about this girl he dated that was really ticklish or something (I wasn’t really listening) and then (while I’m FaceTiming him) he tickles his friend (the one that’s a girl, that also works as a stripper and a sugar baby) and it made me really upset so I said I had to go a few minutes after.

334,8k21gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k21gv/miss_him_or_the_relationship/,Miss him or the relationship?,"This if going to be a book. Sorry I’m advanced. A little back story first. I[18] was with a guy [19] for almost 2 years. Things were great at first, but then 6 months into our relationship, he admitted he had cheated on me while drunk with a girl (whom he introduced me to before he admitted this). I thought about t and made the decision to stay. To my knowledge, that was the only time he did. 

Fast forward a bit, he was a heavy pot smoker. I was not. He spent a lot of his money on it and it bothered me because it got to the point that it was all he eventually wanted to do. He didn’t go to school and he worked at a minimum wage job. Still lived with his parents. Smoked all day and slept. We went out and did things but not a lot. 

He didn’t like any of my guy friends or female friends. I went to senior week and he was mad at me the whole time. He came down to where we were staying without telling me and told me to hang with him and not his friends. I told him no and he went home and threatened to break up with me. He didn’t come to any of my school or family functions. He never came to my house, I always went to his place. 

I eventually got into college and he told me it wasn’t going to work at first. Even though my college wasn’t even an hour from home. My first semester starts and he visits me once. Because he “doesn’t have the money”.

He always threatened to kill himself (I actually picked him up from the hospital because the police heard and they took him there) and he smoked a lot and he told me I needed professional help. He wouldn’t sit down and have a serious conversation with me. He would laugh and tell me I’m being ridiculous. He hated ALL of my friends, especially my guy friends. He didn’t trust me even though I never gave him a reason not to. 

Fast forward a bit more, I break up with him just after thanksgiving. I told him that I just didn’t think I was in love with him any more, but that I love him. It takes me about 3 months to actually break up with him because he kept threatening to kill himself or he’d call me multiple times a day until I’d answer. He’d call my mom and talk to her about me. 

Not all of the relationship was bad. There were some very good parts. We would go hiking, watch lots of movies, we’d go on walks. He made me laugh and I know he genuinely cared about me. But I haven’t talked to him in like 3 months and I miss him terribly. The thought of him with somebody else feels like somebody is punching a hole in my chest. I want to talk to him but I feel as if that’s a bad idea. I can’t tell if I miss him, or who he used to be, or the idea of the relationship. The last time I spoke to him, he told me that he finally understood why I broke up with him, that I was ready to grow and he wasn’t and he didn’t treat me like I deserved. Which was right. So part of me believes he changed so that part of me wants to go back. Any advice??

Now unfortunately red flags start popping up everywhere, here is this woman that I think is super responsible, having her own apartment which I visit every once in a while, and going to work consistently and actively working toward getting a car. She can't make rent most of the time and asks her mom for money alot and when her mom can't I'm the last resort. When she is at work she will find anyway to get off of work to either hangout with me at my house or a friend at the club, getting to work is another ordeal because if she doesn't get a ride with her mom or has her mom's car she ask me and if I'm doing something important I have to pick her up if not she starts crying and saying she has noone to help her in life which makes me feel guilty. My family feels like my relationship is too young for me to be spending this much money on her and almost inconceivable that I would be spending money to support a person that I don't even live with, they also feel like I'm being manipulated though sympathy and compassion of her situation and most of them are thinking that I should break up with her. Im starting to have doubts myself, she is an amazing person with a bubbly outgoing personality but she is very hard headed and as long as these problem persist it's going to be really hard to say ILY back, I can't pay for everything and eventually I'm just not going to. PLS EVERYONE WHO SEES THIS POST PLS COMMENT ALL INPUT HELPS ME THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE POINT IN MY LIFE, THIS IS MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND EVER I NEED AS MUCH ADVISE AS POSSIBLE SO I CAN MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE.  THANK YOU!!!

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments guys I really appreciate it I've given it alot of thought the last day and a half and I've proceeded to keep a straight face around my girlfriend until I'm ready to have the conversation because I still want to give her a chance, but how she takes it will trigger a response from me that she probably won't like but I won't know till I do it, wish me luck. And also one more thing what boundaries should I set before having the conversation?

EDIT2: Well she put the final nail in the coffin, during work she realized that she doesn't have money for rent and since her and my mom have a good relationship (or so she thinks) she wanted to ask my mom for rent money and i lost it, after i get my money back she is gone from my life.

Basic Situation: I've been seeing this women for six months. She (very understandably) wants some level of commitment from me. I'm having difficulty committing because of a few demographic factors I vocalized early on (difference in age, religion, impending geographic change for me) and possibly personal interaction factors (she is more mercurial than I am and texts a lots - but I think this may be due to her very understandable concerns over the stability of the relationship).

Detailed Situation: Hot her number six months ago and started to hang out as friends. Got drunk and (I can't remember if prompted) but told her that I had a lot of concerns because of our differences in religion (Catholic / Hindu - both at least moderately observing) and the age difference (I've never really considered someone older and this is very new). Her reaction was to question why I was interested in her at all, but in retrospect I think she was probably hurt by me putting a potential relationship with her in a box. 

A very quick aside- I've been in relationships before, and I've broken up with women before at ~6 months because I didn't see it going anywhere so there is something more that's driven me to make a post here. I'm a fairly attractive professional and she is similarly attractive and educated.

We start to hang out several times a week as friends, eventually spending the night with each other, then morphing into a situation where we are practically in a relationship, but one limited because I have an impending move across country that has been repeatedly delayed (from last winter to, now, the upcoming fall). We've met each others friends, celebrated birthdays, etc. Over the last two months she has politely asked me to figure out whether this has any long-term potential for me (in so many words). I've said I needed to think it over, then put it off again and again, and it's come to a head. I've had trouble considering it clearly, and that's driven me here

Factors and question: I want to reiterate that I am genuinely torn about this and would appreciate analysis and advice beyond 'if you have any doubts don't do it' (though I appreciate taking the time to give me advice!) I have broken up and been broken up with plenty in the past so this isn't just a matter of fortitude. I'm struggling to even set myself down to think about this rationally but here's my thoughts:

For: Probably most importantly, I enjoy spending time with her and she is great in person (as opposed to text). She is caring and goes out of her way to be supportive and caring. She has ambitions. She is, both with me and what I know of her past, dedicated and loyal. She is educated and professional and capable of helping support a household. She seems willing to work her life around my impending moves. She embraces and supports my hobbies and my friends, and when I ask for or take time for myself or my friends she does not question it or make complaints. She is broadly easy going with small things. Beyond our individual relationship, she is a good friend to her other friends, and makes time for other people.

Against: I don't know if it's because of anxiety I've caused by not being clear about the future of our relationship (I strongly suspect that motivates a good portion of it) but she seems to often find things to fight about, the age and religious difference still great a huge deal of hesitance for me (but I really tend to be inclined to be extremely slow to make big decisions and in the past I feel like I've walked away from relationships I wish I would have followed through on). She texts a lot and I do not at all, and though she is very upbeat and positive in person she tends to bring a lot of problems out in walls of texts that makes communication difficult. Related, we have the stereotypical gender difference of me being very solution-oriented to problems vs. her wanting empathy and understanding that generates most of our conflict (though she goes out of her way to verify with her friends and possibly other sources see if she has a reason to really be upset, and does apologize when she doesn't). 

The biggest thing, really at the heart of all of this, is we get along so well but I feel like our relationship is so punctuated with conflict (which I really dislike), and I don't know how much of that is caused by her concern over whether I'm willing to commit. And I struggle to weigh the pros and cons in such a major decision.

So, after several instances of putting it off, this has really come to a point where I need to decide. And I'm having trouble. I feel like I have never really been able to set myself out to think about it - I don't know if I've really been able to give myself a chance to view this for what it could be. But it is also obviously immature and irresponsible for me to keep dragging this out. Any advice and analysis would be appreciated, and I'll try to answer questions. I'm 
sorry for the long post but I think that's probably normal for this sort of subreddit.

tl;dr Guy struggles with commitment with a girl. He uses atypical differences in religion, age, and impending geographic changes to delay making a decision. He really, really enjoys his time with her otherwise (though there are headaches) and would appreciate advice.","['30', 'm', 'reddit', 'help', '35', 'f', 'girlfriend', 'feel', 'little', 'like', 'man', 'child', 'crowdsource', 'know', 'default', 'response', 'seriously', 'tear', 'appreciate', 'advice', 'basic', 'situation', 'see', 'woman', 'month', 'understandably', 'want', 'level', 'commitment', 'have', 'difficulty', 'commit', 'demographic', 'factor', 'vocalize', 'early', 'difference', 'age', 'religion', 'impend', 'geographic', 'change', 'possibly', 'personal', 'interaction', 'factor', 'mercurial', 'text', 'lot', 'think', 'understandable', 'concern', 'stability', 'relationship', 'detailed', 'situation', 'hot', 'number', 'month', 'ago', 'start', 'hang', 'friend', 'get', 'drunk', 'remember', 'prompt', 'tell', 'lot', 'concern', 'difference', 'religion', 'catholic', 'hindu', 'moderately', 'observe', 'age', 'difference', 'consider', 'old', 'new', 'reaction', 'question', 'interested', 'retrospect', 'think', 'probably', 'hurt', 'put', 'potential', 'relationship', 'box', 'quick', 'aside-', 'relationship', 'break', 'woman', '~6', 'month', 'go', 'drive', 'post', 'fairly', 'attractive', 'professional', 'similarly', 'attractive', 'educated', 'start', 'hang', 'time', 'week', 'friend', 'eventually', 'spend', 'night', 'morph', 'situation', 'practically', 'relationship', 'limited', 'impending', 'country', 'repeatedly', 'delay', 'winter', 'upcoming', 'fall', 'meet', 'friend', 'celebrated', 'birthday', 'etc', 'month', 'politely', 'ask', 'figure', 'long', 'term', 'potential', 'word', 'say', 'need', 'think', 'come', 'head', 'trouble', 'consider', 'clearly', 'drive', 'factor', 'question', 'want', 'reiterate', 'genuinely', 'tear', 'appreciate', 'analysis', 'advice', 'doubt', 'appreciate', 'take', 'time', 'advice', 'break', 'break', 'plenty', 'past', 'matter', 'fortitude', 'struggle', 'set', 'think', 'rationally', 'here', 'thought', 'probably', 'importantly', 'enjoy', 'spend', 'time', 'great', 'person', 'oppose', 'text', 'care', 'go', 'way', 'supportive', 'caring', 'ambition', 'know', 'past', 'dedicated', 'loyal', 'educate', 'professional', 'capable', 'help', 'support', 'household', 'willing', 'work', 'life', 'impending', 'move', 'embrace', 'support', 'hobby', 'friend', 'ask', 'time', 'friend', 'question', 'complaint', 'broadly', 'easy', 'go', 'small', 'thing', 'individual', 'relationship', 'good', 'friend', 'friend', 'make', 'time', 'people', 'know', 'anxiety', 'cause', 'clear', 'future', 'relationship', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'motivate', 'good', 'portion', 'find', 'thing', 'fight', 'age', 'religious', 'difference', 'great', 'huge', 'deal', 'hesitance', 'tend', 'incline', 'extremely', 'slow', 'big', 'decision', 'past', 'feel', 'like', 'walk', 'away', 'relationship', 'wish', 'follow', 'text', 'lot', 'upbeat', 'positive', 'person', 'tend', 'bring', 'lot', 'problem', 'wall', 'text', 'make', 'communication', 'difficult', 'relate', 'stereotypical', 'gender', 'difference', 'solution', 'orient', 'problem', 'vs.', 'want', 'empathy', 'understanding', 'generate', 'conflict', 'go', 'way', 'verify', 'friend', 'possibly', 'source', 'reason', 'upset', 'apologize', 'big', 'thing', 'heart', 'feel', 'like', 'relationship', 'punctuate', 'conflict', 'dislike', 'know', 'cause', 'concern', 'willing', 'commit', 'struggle', 'weigh', 'pro', 'con', 'major', 'decision', 'instance', 'put', 'come', 'point', 'need', 'decide', 'have', 'trouble', 'feel', 'like', 'able', 'set', 'think', 'know', 'able', 'chance', 'view', 'obviously', 'immature', 'irresponsible', 'drag', 'advice', 'analysis', 'appreciate', 'try', 'answer', 'question', 'sorry', 'long', 'post', 'think', 'probably', 'normal', 'sort', 'subreddit', 'tl;dr', 'guy', 'struggle', 'commitment', 'girl', 'use', 'atypical', 'difference', 'religion', 'age', 'impend', 'geographic', 'change', 'delay', 'make', 'decision', 'enjoy', 'time', 'headache', 'appreciate', 'advice']"

We have been dating for almost 2 years, and it is really serious.  I'm at a point in my life where I'm thinking about settling down and making long\-term commitments relationship\-wise, and in terms of the romantic commitment we are on the same page.

We also both want kids, eventually, but this is where the issues start \- I absolutely never want to give birth.  I probably could, if I wanted to, I have child\-bearing hips and no family history of uterus problems, but I am literally terrified by the idea of getting pregnant and giving birth.  On a more practical level, I am on a pretty high dosage of anti\-depressants and would have to stop if I was pregnant, which with the pregnancy hormones would mean that I would basically be a giant tornado of instability. incapable of carrying on my daily life.  Beyond that, I just don't see pregnancy or giving birth as anything more than a terrifying, physically demanding and painful experience, and I have had nightmares about it.  I am genuinely terrified of it and I think that I am fully justified in not wanting to do it \(despite the societal pressures\).

However, like I said, I want kids.  I want to be a mom someday \- not in the near future, but someday.  And I have been picturing that happening, for like 10 years at this point, by adopting a child with whoever I end up with.  I am in a field that will provide financial stability, and I think that I would be able to provide a really great adoptive home.  Relationship\-wise, it is really looking like this is the guy.  But, he really wants a biological child.  We have had this conversation several times now and his position on the matter wavers from ""I would not be okay with adoption, I want a biological child"" to ""I would want to have a child with you, whether it's by adoption or whatever"" \- but I am just so scared that we are going to get to the point in our lives where we want to have kids and he just won't be okay with adoption.

Am I blowing this out of proportion by getting so upset so soon?  I know it's early in the relationship, but I just do not feel like spending time entangled with someone who I am ultimately going to have to leave, painfully, because we don't want the same things.  I've considered posting a few times now, but since this is like the fifth time I figured I'd finally try and get reddit's opinion, because I honestly could just use some advice.","['20_s', 'f', 'boyfriend', '20_s', 'm', 'pretty', 'stuck', 'have', 'biological', 'child', 'throwaway', 'generic', 'age', 'go', 'reddit', 'date', '2', 'year', 'point', 'life', 'think', 'settle', 'make', 'long', '-term', 'commitment', 'relationship', '-wise', 'term', 'romantic', 'commitment', 'page', 'want', 'kid', 'eventually', 'issue', 'start', 'absolutely', 'want', 'birth', 'probably', 'want', 'child', '-bearing', 'hip', 'family', 'history', 'uterus', 'problem', 'literally', 'terrify', 'idea', 'get', 'pregnant', 'give', 'birth', 'practical', 'level', 'pretty', 'high', 'dosage', 'anti', '-depressant', 'stop', 'pregnant', 'pregnancy', 'hormone', 'mean', 'basically', 'giant', 'tornado', 'instability', 'incapable', 'carry', 'daily', 'life', 'pregnancy', 'give', 'birth', 'terrifying', 'physically', 'demanding', 'painful', 'experience', 'nightmare', 'genuinely', 'terrified', 'think', 'fully', 'justify', 'want', 'despite', 'societal', 'pressure', 'like', 'say', 'want', 'kid', 'want', 'mom', 'someday', 'near', 'future', 'someday', 'picture', 'happen', 'like', '10', 'year', 'point', 'adopt', 'child', 'end', 'field', 'provide', 'financial', 'stability', 'think', 'able', 'provide', 'great', 'adoptive', 'home', 'relationship', '-wise', 'look', 'like', 'guy', 'want', 'biological', 'child', 'conversation', 'time', 'position', 'matter', 'waver', 'okay', 'adoption', 'want', 'biological', 'child', 'want', 'child', 'adoption', 'scared', 'go', 'point', 'life', 'want', 'kid', 'okay', 'adoption', 'blow', 'proportion', 'get', 'upset', 'soon', 'know', 'early', 'relationship', 'feel', 'like', 'spend', 'time', 'entangle', 'ultimately', 'go', 'leave', 'painfully', 'want', 'thing', 'consider', 'post', 'time', 'like', 'fifth', 'time', 'figure', 'finally', 'try', 'reddit', 'opinion', 'honestly', 'use', 'advice']"

We've been back together for a bit now and its been great. He's trying so much more than he ever did before but it's extremely hard for us. We work opposite schedules \(I open / he closes\). Our days off hardly align. He lives an hour away \(not the worst\) but I also don't have a car. Though we both live on our own so we always spend the night when we do hang out. It's been about two weeks since I've seen him since my schedule has been hectic but I finally get a day off when he does. 

So currently one of his friends from our hometown is visiting. \(let's call him John\) So John will be staying for a week, staying with my BF and his roommates \(all are friends from high school\). It just so happens he's in town in the small amount of time we can hang out. I told my BF I'd understand if he couldn't make the time to hang out all day and spend the night, but I'd still like to grab lunch or hang out for a bit. He told me he'll have to see. Then later on during the day he talked about how he's gonna take a few days off to hang out with John.  

I asked him since he'll be off for a few days, why not use one day to come hang with me. He just says ""maybe"" but when he says this, its basically his nice way of saying ""no"". 

I get that it's his friend and all and it has been a few months since they've seen each other, but is it wrong that I feel a little let down? I feel bad for well feeling bad. I want to be understanding and give him his bro time but is it a little too much to ask for a little of ""us"" time too? I invited him and his friends over too \(we're all pretty good friends and within the same friend group\) to come over for a little kickback on my day off instead so we can all hang out and I get us time. Once again the ""maybe"" came up. 

I want to bring up how I'm feeling, but I don't have to come off as wanting attention or clingy or anything.

 Well here goes! I met a girl through her sister i used to hangout with.

up until this last February we are no longer Friends of 4 years cause her new boyfriend who is totally a bad choice.

One day i decided to ask her out on a date jokingly cause i know we were just friends obviously, I was gonna go to the circus. I thought i would ask her but her boyfriend started saying i was harassing her but clearly i wasn't i just was trying to get a hold of her on Facebook cause its really the only way i can communicate with people.

as you can see i'm disabled i have duchenne muscular Dystrophy and permanently on a ventilator.

Well this guy started talking to me like i'm not a human. I mean some pretty harsh things i can't say on here.

i told her we were done since she didn't apologize for letting him shit on me. We did everything together i took her out to dinner quite frequently bought her expensive jewelry like a $300 dollar bracelet and other types of jewelry.

I still really care about her and  i deeply miss her.  I mean I got a horrible disease but i'm a very good person and a genuine guy how could someone be so heartless to a nice guy.

346,8k1d28,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k1d28/caught_in_limbo_after_agreeing_to_take/,Caught in limbo after agreeing to take relationship to next level with recently divorced best friend,"  Six years ago I met a girl who I immediately fell in love with, after a month into our friendship, in a hotel room she made clear she was not interested because she had a fiancée. We became best friends, spent most of everyday together throughout college and while I would like to admit that I had pushed off the idea of ever being with her, I secretly harbored a dim hope. Up until that point, she had had a rough life in which everyone she cared about had left her or abused their relationship with her. I had determined that if I loved her, it didn’t matter the nature of our relationship, I would always be there for her and give her the unending support and care she needed. While I never told her how I really felt, what I really wanted, I always told her I loved her and would always be there for her. After college was over we stayed in touch, though we grew apart after I moved a couple states away and she settled down with her husband.

A year and a half ago, she cut me off. I wasn’t expecting it. Just one day noticed my texts weren’t going through. Didn’t think anything of it, but over the next couple of days realized she had cut me off of everything. Ghosted in every sense of the word by my best friend. Frankly, I was devastated, for months stuff would happen in my life, and I would immediately think of how I wanted to tell her all about it. All I wanted was to talk to my best friend, to know how she was doing and I couldn’t even do that. Over the course of 9 months I realized I would probably never talk to her again, and if I did, it would never be the same. I was a threat to her marriage, and even being her best friend would be impossible to sustain.

Over the course of that 6 years, I did talk to some people, but never dated anyone. I’ve never been in a serious relationship and it didn’t help that all the time I spend in college was with a woman who was married. Furthermore, I’ve never met anyone who is as fun to be around as my best friend. Other relationships have always felt dull in comparison.

Fast forward 9 months from when she cut me off. One night I accidentally butt dialed her and didn’t realize it. She responds telling me we need to catch up, that she misses me. I was elated. We caught up over the phone and she told me everything. To shorten the story, she had cut me out of her life in an attempt to save her failing marriage. Turns out her husband had been cheating on her pretty much the whole time, but she felt trapped and could not escape. After a series of unfortunate events, she decided she could take it no longer and was getting a divorce.

After that we stayed in semi regular contact and I gave her my unending support in everything. Though a part of me was glad there might be a possibility of us, I did not intend to say anything. She was going through enough, and so many males in her life jumped on the bandwagon of trying to get with her when they found out she was getting divorced. In the final days of her divorce, she surprised me by announcing she was flying out to California to see me. When she came out, I took a week off of work and we adventured northern California together, nearly dying together on a mountain and enjoying every moment together. I made absolutely no moves on her, and did not intend to, I wanted her to have one place in the world where she felt safe and I was not going to stress her out more by trying to take advantage of her position.

When she left, I found myself missing her more than I ever had. Until she had come out to California, I was on the top of the world, working at my dream job and enjoying life. But when she left everything became dull, I realized how much I missed my best friend, and that if we lived 3000 miles apart we would likely drift apart again. 

To my delight she said she wanted to come out to California, my boss and CEO even called me in and asked if she would want to work at our company and told me to pass on her contact info to her. I was freaking out, on one hand, I wanted her to so very badly to come out to California, then we could see eachother every day… and maybe after some time there would be room for something more, but also I knew that coming out to Cali would be terrible for her. All of her social support, her family lived back home in Michigan, and she even had a great job opportunity out there. Though it fucking killed me, I resolved that as her closest friend I could not advise her to come out to California and leave her family and friends behind. 

Fast forward a month. We had been talking and texting daily. As Best Friends of course. One day she asks me if she can ask me something uncomfortable about ‘us’. Turns out, she had had breakfast with a mutual friend and she told him all about our plans to go to Europe together. Our friend asked her if she thought me and he could be best friends forever, if we could be best friends if both of us had partners. After thinking about it, she burst into tears, realizing that our relationship had a doomsday clock, that our relationship would decay unless it turned into something more. She posed the question to me, asking if I thought if it was realistic that we could remain as close as we were forever, I of course said no. After a long discussion she said she wanted to try to make us work, to give us a try, but because she had only finalized her divorce 20 days prior, she wanted to have some time to be single. 

In that whole discussion, I never told her how I really felt about her, that I always loved her. I was scared to admit it for fear of rejection. So we had formally agreed out of mutual realization that our friendship was doomed, so we might as well try. After rather formally agreeing to this, I was not quick to get excited. She has the tendency to make really rash decisions and proclamations, so I was cautious.  As expected 3 days later, she texted me confused, saying “I’m really confused, Mark \(our friend\), thinks you are madly in love with me and always have been, and I just don’t know why he thinks that."" At that I responded say “ Well… you never asked that”… and then told her how I really felt. 

We ended up talking the next morning, and again I told her how much I cared about her and loved her. I was scared shittless, I thought she would be freaked out, and scared away. Instead she was like “Why didn’t you say something sooner!”. She affirmed that she loved me and that she could not imagine life without me, that she was even more sure about trying to make us work. We talked about timing, and she said she didn’t want to make me wait, but she did need time to be by herself before jumping into another relationship. In her words “I want to do this but I want to make sure that I can put 100&#37; of me into it and I just need a little time before I can do that"" 

Now emotionally I am in a position I’ve never been in. I’m in this weird limbo with my best friend in which she has said she wants to date me but wants a little time. Simultaneously, we currently live 3000 miles away since she accepted a job back in Michigan the day before we made this realization so its nearly impossible to see her in person. I travel 100&#37; of the time, but don’t have a place of residence so I can technically work from anywhere, all I would have to do is tell my boss I want to go back home and I could. 

I really want to see her, but don’t want to rush her into things. Simultaneously, I miss her like crazy and trying to maintain this weird relationship over phone and text is emotionally killing me. Things are a little weird now that we moved to this transition stage. And I am worried sick that the longer we go without seeing eachother the more likely this thing will fail. I’ve never really been in any sort of relationship, so on top of it all I am really worried about overthinking this, of being overbearing, and rushing into things. 

Any advice on how to not drive myself crazy with this? I want to just talk to her about everything however I feel that talking about it too much will become overbearing for her and push her away. Or am I just overthinking things?","['catch', 'limbo', 'agree', 'relationship', 'level', 'recently', 'divorce', 'good', 'friend', 'year', 'ago', 'meet', 'girl', 'immediately', 'fall', 'love', 'month',

First thing I do is text my best friend to tell her. She knows that I’ve been depressed lately and this is just such a good thing for me. But she isn’t acting happy for me at all. She is responding with one word texts instead of her usual (at least) sentence or two. 

Some back story; we’ve been best friends since 7th grade and now we are seniors in high school. About two years ago she told me that she had a crush on me. I told her I didn’t like her back, at least not that way. And that was that. We continued being best friends and moved on. She has made comments here and there and has made it obvious that her crush is still there. I ignore it because I don’t want to ruin our close friendship. I think she feels entitled or something like that since I am bisexual (therefore able to be attracted to her), close to her, and we like all the same things. I’ve just never seen her that way. So I understand why she isn’t happy for me, I just don’t know how to respond to her cold shoulder. I can’t lose her, she is my rock.

We've been on 3 dates, talking on the phone and texting daily, and he recently spent the night at mine.  I thought it was going great.  Until... lol.  

We were having a chat the other night and he was saying he missed being next to me.  To which I replied, no sense in missing me, just ask to hangout out again.  I had 5 days off work in a row, he knew a week ahead of my time off, and hadn't asked once for a date, or to hang out, nothing.  

I'm an analytical girl and I think out loud, in that, I throw things out to bounce off people.  I'm conscious of people's feelings, but I am honest about my thoughts and feelings.  And, to me, if we are both adults making our own schedules,  and you aren't even trying to have us hang out, what's the point in missing me?  It makes no sense bc we could be hanging out.  I made it very clear that I was off work and would like to hang out.

He got mad, stopped replying to me, and the next day said I was judging him and that I need to learn to stop saying what I think out loud.  I was like, that is not how that works.  If you don't like my communication style, we aren't a good fit.  Nothing personal,  but that's a core part of my personality. I'm not mean  or rude, or inconsiderate,  or hateful, but I think out loud.  I process verbally, with whoever I'm talking to.  

Are there men who will appreciate that?  Or am I supposed to learn to keep everything to myself and only talk when I know something 100%?  Bc I'm not sure I can even learn to do that,  the way I process and think is so verbal.  Is this something that I need to work on?  My initial reaction is, this isn't a good fit if 3 dates in he is already complaining about a core personality trait of mine, and chalking it up as a loss and moving on.  But, I'm interested in other's opinions, to see if I'm hitting a blind spot about myself.

I don't even like her.","I married a woman I deeply loved and treasured and she's become a fucking nightmare. Her habits have degenerated into nothing short of disgusting. And when I tell her this, she just reacts with contempt.

She's a fat cruel bitch, who obsesses over a cat that she refuses to clean up after and take care of. She leaves her garbage all over the house \(empty bowls and cups and food wrappers digging into the carpet we walk on is the bane of my existence\) She is obsessed with food and hates herself for it. The sofa's are soaked in urine from the cat she refuses to train/get rid of. She insults me whenever she feels like it. Calling me a moron or a child or stupid. She demands control of my superior income because she refuses to let me handle my own finances. When I threatened to switch banks she threatened to divorce me. 

Everyday she comes home from a job she fucking hates but won't leave because she's an underachiever, and plants her horizontal body on the sofa in front of youtube and just lies there like a dead fish until she rolls into bed around 10 to get up and do it again tomorrow. She doesn't want to do anything with me. We live in a expensive city full of amazing things to do and all she ever wants to do is go somewhere and get food. She's not even that overweight. But I'm not even sexually attracted to her anymore, mostly because of her disgusting lifestyle. 

I'm supposed to love her for better or worse, I made a vow before God to be a loving and supporting husband.  

But she's turned into this incredibly detestable person. I just keep burying my feelings about it but I don't think she wants to change.

I've asked her to go to therapy for herself or with me, but she won't. I've told her that I need her to be better or I'll have no choice but to walk but then she just tells me ''Fine go on then!''

What am I supposed to do in this situation? I feel like she's my cross to bare in life, not my loving partner.

Met girl at work, started hanging out with her, started liking her, found out she had a boyfriend. I know I should have stopped liking her there and then, but the heart tells me something different.

I might be wearing rose tinted glasses and not seeing those red-flags, but even though she's not the most stylish, make really bad jokes and is pretty mean sometimes, I still think that she's cheeky, silly and fun to be around. And slowly but surely I've fallen for her, there are so many things wrong with these feelings but I simply can't toss them out, she's simply the best person I've ever met and being with her even as just friends has made me a better person.

I honestly have no idea what to do now, she occupies my head at home, and we hang out a lot, I can't let her go and I can't pursue her, if anyone has some good advice it would be very helpful...

Thanks... :(","['complicated', 'feeling', 'girl', 'honest', 'want', 'vent', 'bit', 'like', 'girl', 'probably', 'bad', 'idea', 'begin', 'advice', 'deal', 'nice', 'story', 'meet', 'girl', 'work', 'start', 'hang', 'start', 'like', 'find', 'boyfriend', 'know', 'stop', 'like', 'heart', 'tell', 'different', 'wear', 'rise', 'tint', 'glass', 'see', 'red', 'flag', 'stylish', 'bad', 'joke', 'pretty', 'mean', 'think', 'cheeky', 'silly', 'fun', 'slowly', 'surely', 'fall', 'thing', 'wrong', 'feeling', 'simply', 'toss', 'simply', 'good', 'person', 'meet', 'friend', 'well', 'person', 'honestly', 'idea', 'occupy', 'head', 'home', 'hang', 'lot', 'let', 'pursue', 'good', 'advice', 'helpful', 'thank']"

In fact, I love sex. I especially love sex with my partner, but I don’t find it especially important. As a single person, I had a lot of superfluous sex. I never spent the night, never cuddled, often didn’t call the next day. Sex was the only type of relationship I had for a long time and those relationships lasted a few hours at best before I headed home to be alone. I’ve had a few long term relationships in the past but I found myself uninterested in the person I was with and always assumed my lack of sexual desire with them came from my lack of attraction to them. Now I’m in this relationship of 4 years where I am still incredibly attracted to my partner and really do enjoy our sex, but still making sex a low priority. I find things like holding her close for long amounts of time so much more intimate than sex. She, on the other hand, feels the opposite. Sex and emotion are closely tied for her. The more sex a couple has, the happier their relationship is to her. She thinks I have a low sex drive but it confuses her because we were like rabbits when we first started dating...you know, before all the love really set in for me...when I still didn’t know if this was going to be serious. When it did become serious though, my sex drive sank. What is it about me that makes commitment kill sex? I feel like my emotionless sexual past makes it impossible for me to find emotion in sex and therefore makes it unimportant to me. I don’t want want my partner to feel unfulfilled in our relationship or like I don’t want her. I feel terrible that I’m like this and even more terrible for the way it makes her feel. There has to be a way to fix this mentality, right? I cannot be the only one who feels like this, can I?

Looking for advice or words of wisdom.","I have been dating my girlfriend for over 2 years now and things have been moving to very serious the last 6 months but as this has happened things have also gotten a little messy. Fights break out over little things and we just haven't been consistently super all the time. I believe this is the result of me being difficult lately and very sensitive because I have felt extremely guilty of not letting her know that towards the beginning of the relationship when drunk and hanging out with old friends from high school I let a girl start kissing me and I went with it for a second until she tried to take things farther and started going down on me until I stopped it after it started. I stopped it but by then it was too late and it was a dumb drunk blur of an event. I know drunk isn't an excuse.


As much as I hate it I did cheat on my girlfriend somewhat and I didn't have the guts to tell her at the time. Time went on and on until I felt like I was rotting on the inside and it was time to cut out the rot and stop being a coward. But now that I told her I may lose her and she wanted to take a break for at least a couple weeks before shell speak to me. I know it was the best thing to do but I feel like I want to make improvements in my life because I am not the same guy who would let something like that slipup happen again and just want to be a better dude. I lost my confidence and self esteem from hiding that, so I would really appreciate advice as to where to go from here, whether things work or not between my girlfriend and I.

We've lived together since June '16 and I\(F\) came with a cat, he was anti the idea of me getting another one and then when I did, he learned he actually loves the furry little gremlin. That isn't the problem.

I'm studying midwifery full time, and half way through my second year. This is a challanging programme and he has also recently changed jobs.

Our sex life is struggling, and it has always been lead by him and his reasonably low sex drive. This caused friction intitially until we talked about it.

Recently we had another more serious discussion before going to a concert. Neither of us are happy and we don't know how to fix it. He directly asked me if I'm happy. I thought I was. I desperately wanted to make it work.

I still want to fix it, but I don't know how.

Writing this is harder than I thought it was, I'm sitting in the uni library trying to keep my wits together.

Part of me doesn't want to fix it. But is scared of losing him. 

I'm NOT interested in anyone else. We haven't had any major issues in the time we've been together, but it feels like the passion has died and we've both mentioned this. 

I'm after strategies to help us either figure out what we want, or ways to improve our relationship. This is he longest relationship either of us have had, and communication isn't always the easiest as he doesn't know \(his own words\) how to talk about his feelings, and I have too many feelings but can't articulate them without sounding like I'm refusing to take responsibility for things which are my own doing/fault.","['stick', 'confused', 'stay', 'background', 'november', '15', 'nearly', '30', 'live', 'june', '16', 'f', 'come', 'cat', 'anti', 'idea', 'get', 'learn', 'actually', 'love', 'furry', 'little', 'gremlin', 'problem', 'study', 'midwifery', 'time', 'half', 'way', 'second', 'year', 'challange', 'programme', 'recently', 'change', 'job', 'sex', 'life', 'struggle', 'lead', 'reasonably', 'low', 'sex', 'drive', 'cause', 'friction', 'intitially', 'talk', 'recently', 'discussion', 'go', 'concert', 'happy', 'know', 'fix', 'directly', 'ask', 'happy', 'think', 'desperately', 'want', 'work', 'want', 'fix', 'know', 'write', 'hard', 'think', 'sit', 'uni', 'library', 'try', 'wit', 'want', 'fix', 'scared', 'lose', 'interested', 'major', 'issue', 'time', 'feel', 'like', 'passion', 'die', 'mention', 'strategy', 'help', 'figure', 'want', 'way', 'improve', 'relationship', 'long', 'relationship', 'communication', 'easy', 'know', 'word', 'talk', 'feeling', 'feeling', 'articulate', 'sound', 'like', 'refuse', 'responsibility', 'thing', 'fault']"
354,8k108y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k108y/my_boyfriend_compromised_when_i_wasnt_expecting/,My boyfriend compromised when I wasn't expecting him to....,"So, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years, with us both being 26 y.o. Since the year and a half mark, I had been trying to talk about a future together; getting married, having kids and he basically always shot me down saying either ""I don't know what I want"" or straight up changing the subject.  Well, after hearing this for so long, I figured after being together for over 2 years without him ""knowing"" he was just making excuses and stringing me along so i started to lose most of my feelings for him. I also asked him if he thought I loved him more than he loved me and he said ""yes, definitely"" \(this was about 3 weeks ago\). He also said that in order for him to take the next step, he would need to make more money to feel secure in doing that, regardless of how much money I make \(I make pretty decent money\). He also isn't in school and has no plans to study anything.

Recently, in about the past two months, I was planning on breaking up with him because I was tired of not knowing where the relationship was going. When I went to break up with him, something unexpected happened though. I told him that the reason I was breaking up with him was because I wanted kids and a future and to be more than ""someones girlfriend"" forever. I also told him it wouldn't be fair to be with someone who loves me less than I love him. He replied asking me what he could do to make me stay, and I told him I needed a time frame for when he would be willing to take the next step. I then slept over at his house that night and when we went for breakfast the next morning, he said ""I am not ready now, but when I am 29\-33, I will be ready"", and I agreed. He even offered to finish inside of me that night, but it didn't happen.

The problem I face now is that my feelings are severely diminished since I was fully preparing for him to not compromise. I braced myself for the single life based on what he's been saying. He's a great person, which is why I want to stay and work through my feelings instead of just giving up. I also feel like he was truly sincere in wanting me to stay and that he's not just tricking me so he could date me another couple of years. I feel guilty sometimes because I do think about giving up on us. I don't know how to get my full feelings back to what they once were.

About us: I am the only girl he's ever slept and had a relationship with \(he's really shy\) and our relationship has been long distance for roughly the past 2ish years \(I live a 5 hour drive away, but come down every other week for 3\-4 days at a time\). He still lives with his parents and I have my own apartment. He's filipino and lived in the phillipines during his childhood. His parents are still married and going strong and so are my parents. We both grew up big families. He's non\-practising catholic, and I'm non\-practising Christain.

I'd also like to say that English is not my first language, so I'm sorry if you find some mistakes. :(

We've been together for a long time (4 years) with ups and downs, and we decided to make it official almost two years ago. The thing is that we've always been together no matter what, no matter how much pain it meant. We don't live together, but we sleep at each other's house two to five days a week.

Eight months ago he cheated on me with this girl who lived in another country, but was staying in our city for a couple of months. When I found out about it I went crazy, but we ended up talking about it pretty calmly. The thing is that he had a really bad year last year, he dealt with stress, loss, anxiety and depression, and he said he needed a way to escape. Even though he felt sorry I knew that he loved her in some kind of way, maybe not as much as he loved me or not in the same way, but I knew it. After that, she left to her homeland and I never knew anything else about her.

Since then we've been working really hard on this relationship. Planning things every day, talking about what we love and what we fear, spending as much time together as possible, not letting the problems win, talking when there was something we needed to change, being rational and on a healthy relationship. And now we're happier than ever (maybe not right now...). We both worked really hard and it paid off. He wakes up by my side smiling and saying that I am the woman of his life.

Then, three days ago I started to feel that he was acting weird. I felt him distant, he didn't put much effort in the things we had planned, etc. And... Yesterday he told me he spent the night with the girl he cheated on me (she will be a couple of days in our city). I cried as much as my chest let me, I threw up, I had a terrible headache, I just couldn't believe it...

Since he cheated on me, I've been having the worst trust issues, I've never tried to control him, but I am anxious when he goes out with his friends or if he acts weird. The worst thing is that the day before he started acting weird we talked about my trust issues and he showed himself as the most loving and caring person. He asked me to make a list of the things I'd like him to do in order to trust him again.

He has told me that they ended up in a really bad way and they really wanted to say goodbye in person for the last time. After that, I just can't count how many times he said he was sorry, how many times he's told me he loves me and wants to be with me, how many time he has cried and that he wants to earn my trust back. We've talked about getting married for a while now and he said that it may be a good time to do it since it would demonstrate I am his only one.

BUT everything has to change, right? Just a couple of hours later he has told me that he was not so sure about the wedding. He wanted to be sincere with me and said that meeting the girl made him remember things and that he kind of missed her. That he just wanted to tell me the truth and not lie.

At this point I just don't really know what to do. After telling me that he missed her, he just said that even though everything seems weird he's still here with me and that he wants to fix everything and go back to the happy couple we were just four days ago.

What should I do? How am I supposed to feel? I feel this text is reeeaally long, but so are my headaches. I love him so much, he's helped me go through everything, he's made me realize how amazing and beautiful I can be.

Thank you so much, I hope you can help me <3","['happy', 'couple', '23', 'f', 'yesterday', '24', 'm', 'meet', 'girl', 'cheat', 'like', 'create', 'new', 'account', 'order', 'stay', 'private', 'know', 'usual', 'username', 'like', 'english', 'language', 'sorry', 'find', 'mistake', 'long', 'time', '4', 'year', 'up', 'down', 'decide', 'official', 'year', 'ago', 'thing', 'matter', 'matter', 'pain', 'mean', 'live', 'sleep', 'house', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'ago', 'cheat', 'girl', 'live', 'country', 'stay', 'city', 'couple', 'month', 'find', 'go', 'crazy', 'end', 'talk', 'pretty', 'calmly', 'thing', 'bad', 'year', 'year', 'deal', 'stress', 'loss', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'say', 'need', 'way', 'escape', 'feel', 'sorry', 'know', 'love', 'kind', 'way', 'maybe', 'love', 'way', 'know', 'leave', 'homeland', 'know', 'work', 'hard', 'relationship', 'plan', 'thing', 'day', 'talk', 'love', 'fear', 'spend', 'time', 'possible', 'let', 'problem', 'win', 'talk', 'need', 'change', 'rational', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'happy', 'maybe', 'right', 'work', 'hard', 'pay', 'wake', 'smile', 'say', 'woman', 'life', 'day', 'ago', 'start', 'feel', 'act', 'weird', 'feel', 'distant', 'effort', 'thing', 'plan', 'etc', 'yesterday', 'tell', 'spend', 'night', 'girl', 'cheat', 'couple', 'day', 'city', 'cry', 'chest', 'let', 'throw', 'terrible', 'headache', 'believe', 'cheat', 'have', 'bad', 'trust', 'issue', 'try', 'control', 'anxious', 'go', 'friend', 'act', 'weird', 'bad', 'thing', 'day', 'start', 'act', 'weird', 'talk', 'trust', 'issue', 'show', 'loving', 'caring', 'person', 'ask', 'list', 'thing', 'like', 'order', 'trust', 'tell', 'end', 'bad', 'way', 'want', 'goodbye', 'person', 'time', 'count', 'time', 'say', 'sorry', 'time', 'tell', 'love', 'want', 'time', 'cry', 'want', 'earn', 'trust', 'talk', 'get', 'marry', 'say', 'good', 'time', 'demonstrate', 'change', 'right', 'couple', 'hour', 'later', 'tell', 'sure', 'wedding', 'want', 'sincere', 'say', 'meet', 'girl', 'remember', 'thing', 'kind', 'miss', 'want', 'tell', 'truth', 'lie', 'point', 'know', 'tell', 'miss', 'say', 'weird', 'want', 'fix', 'happy', 'couple', 'day', 'ago', 'suppose', 'feel', 'feel', 'text', 'reeeaally', 'long', 'headache', 'love', 'help', 'realize', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'thank', 'hope', 'help', '<3']"

So instead, I told him he looked good in his uniform but also that I was not mentally prepared to talk to him. The next week, I would put myself in places where I knew I would see him, and I would say ""Hi"".  However, the conversation never expanded from a simple greeting. I'm a very honest and blunt person, so I figured since I liked him I should just tell him. So I went to his workplace and told him I had a crush on him/liked him and that I wanted to hang out the next Friday, on senior skip day. He told me he wasn't sure if he was working that day, but ""yeah"". So I asked if we could exchange numbers, he handed me his phone and I put my number in. Prior to this, I had written my number down on a piece of paper without my name and left it on his desk titled to him. I went back later and saw that it wasn't in the trash or on the floor and that he took it. But, he never texted me.

The next Thursday, the day before senior skip day, I was in the mall on my way to work and I saw him. He was standing farther down, but looked over at me three times and started walking ahead towards a hallway. He stopped randomly, even though I was on the opposite side of the mall. Later that day after my shift ended, I was waiting near the security office/bathroom. And he came in with a coworker from a side entrance, I was squatting but I know he saw me, yet he didn't say anything or acknowledge me. A few weeks went by, and neither of us said anything. But, last Saturday he came into my workplace, because we called for security due to stealing. When I saw him, my heart jumped and I instantly got nervous. I whispered loudly across the store, ""(Crush's name) Hi"", he said it back but nothing happened. And then 2-3 minutes later, I went over and asked how ""he was doing and how his shift was going?"" He said something I didn't hear clearly, but we laughed. I had already been pondering if I should ask him to hangout another day, so after work I knew I had to say something. He was hanging at the customers service desk with a coworker talking to the customer service girl. So I went over to the Coffee shop right across and began talking to my friend about the situation. I don't how but he realized I was there and kepting turning around looking at me. 

So, after awhile I went over, tapped him on the shoulder and asked if we could talk. He said, ""yeah"" and I flat out said, "" I gave you my number and you never texted. Do you have a girlfriend or are you not interested?"". He surprisingly with a flabbergasted smile on his face said, ""I get that your into me, but we should stay friends."" So I asked again, ""Are you not interested?"" And he paused and lowly said, ""No."" At that point I walked away. I was confused because, prior to me telling him how I felt and giving him my number, he didn't know my name and we had never really spoken. To many the answer is clear, but granted, he's a very different person. He doesn't talk and doesn't smile, most people don't even notice he's around. He's really introverted,  has a resting bitch face and is really hard to read. I know I approached him too forwardly, but I don't know if he's not interested or awkward and shy. Or if I ruined my chances with him. He still doesn't acknowledge me in school, but I did see him look at me. I really like him and don't know what to do. If you've made it to the bottom, please give me some advice and tell me what you think?","['emotion', 'shy', 'interested', '17_f', 'crush', 'guy', 'school', '2', 'year', 'recently', 'tell', 'like', 'get', 'word', 'work', 'local', 'mall', 'go', 'weekend', 'pretend', 'like', 'know', 'talk', 'originally', 'want', 'ask', 'number', 'hang', 'feel', 'soon', 'speak', 'instead', 'tell', 'look', 'good', 'uniform', 'mentally', 'prepared', 'talk', 'week', 'place', 'know', 'hi', 'conversation', 'expand', 'simple', 'greeting', 'honest', 'blunt', 'person', 'figure', 'like', 'tell', 'go', 'workplace', 'tell', 'crush', 'like', 'want', 'hang', 'friday', 'senior', 'skip', 'day', 'tell', 'sure', 'work', 'day', 'yeah', 'ask', 'exchange', 'number', 'hand', 'phone', 'number', 'prior', 'write', 'number', 'piece', 'paper', 'leave', 'desk', 'title', 'go', 'later', 'see', 'trash', 'floor', 'take', 'texte', 'thursday', 'day', 'senior', 'skip', 'day', 'mall', 'way', 'work', 'see', 'stand', 'farther', 'look', 'time', 'start', 'walk', 'ahead', 'hallway', 'stop', 'randomly', 'opposite', 'mall', 'later', 'day', 'shift', 'end', 'wait', 'near', 'security', 'office', 'bathroom', 'come', 'coworker', 'entrance', 'squat', 'know', 'see', 'acknowledge', 'week', 'go', 'say', 'saturday', 'come', 'workplace', 'call', 'security', 'steal', 'see', 'heart', 'jump', 'instantly', 'get', 'nervous', 'whisper', 'loudly', 'store', 'crushs', 'hi', 'say', 'happen', '2', '3', 'minute', 'later', 'go', 'ask', 'shift', 'go', 'say', 'hear', 'clearly', 'laugh', 'ponder', 'ask', 'hangout', 'day', 'work', 'know', 'hang', 'customer', 'service', 'desk', 'coworker', 'talk', 'customer', 'service', 'girl', 'go', 'coffee', 'shop', 'right', 'begin', 'talk', 'friend', 'situation', 'realize', 'kepte', 'turn', 'look', 'awhile', 'go', 'tap', 'shoulder', 'ask', 'talk', 'say', 'yeah', 'flat', 'say', 'give', 'number', 'texte', 'girlfriend', 'interested', 'surprisingly', 'flabbergasted', 'smile', 'face', 'say', 'stay', 'friend', 'ask', 'interested', 'pause', 'lowly', 'say', 'point', 'walk', 'away', 'confused', 'prior', 'tell', 'feel', 'give', 'number', 'know', 'speak', 'answer', 'clear', 'grant', 'different', 'person', 'talk', 'smile', 'people', 'notice', 'introvert', 'rest', 'bitch', 'face', 'hard', 'read', 'know', 'approach', 'forwardly', 'know', 'interested', 'awkward', 'shy', 'ruin', 'chance', 'acknowledge', 'school', 'look', 'like', 'know', 'advice', 'tell', 'think']"

I caught them cheating, then the guy shortly had to leave town for work, and she was constantly texting him for a month and I think she was into him, but now its been 2 months now, she finally stopped contacting him, I am assuming because he left town and hes not physically here. She never really said why or whats going on with that guy.  From what I have believe, she just wanted to fool around and told the guy all sorts of things to make him believe she was into him. but hes not here at the moment, I think shes thinking whats the point of talking to him.  The guy did book a plane ticket for her to visit him, and he is going to come back in July/August for two weeks.  I know this to be a fact.  However, since shes not talking to him now, part of me doesnt want to ask about it.  but then again, if theres a ticket booked for a flight.  I feel like I need to ask what is going to happen when he comes back,  if shes going to visit him or not etc.  The thing is when I mention about it now, she gets defensive. I know I shouldnt care about her so much, but it still hurts that I cant be with her romantically and she acts like were a couple still and tells me that she would love to stay friends with me. If she ends up visiting or seeing the guy, is it fair to say, I am fuckin stupid for even considering her as a friend?  I dont want to hold a grudge or expect her not to do things, but deep down I feel like I should say, ""if you end up hanging with the guy or going to see him, then I am out.""

We previously toyed with the idea of kids (I want them more than anything), and she came out and basically said kids would impede her career, and she wants the freedom to do what she wants when she wants.


Understandably, these are irreconcilable differences, so (despite not wanting to because she's amazing) I suggested we break up. She then called me later that day sounding like she had been crying and saying ""it would be hard, but I am willing to have children. It won't be the perfect suburban life, but we can do it. I want to start a family with you and it'll be really hard but I think it will be worth it.""


I can't shake the feeling she's only saying these things to get back with me. I don't think this will be healthy for the kids, since it seems like she wants to compromise, not actually have the kids.

So me and my girl have been together for about 2 years and 4 months. And just a few days ago called it quits, and she has been begging for me to take her back. 

I have been for the majority happy for our relationship, despite in the beginning, being worried I'll never be single again to have fun in my 20s. Eventually I got over it and committed to a hopeful future together. Despite every once in a while being drunk and think man I wish I could talk to other girls and ect, slight temptations. I stayed faithful to her and have been happy for the most part about it. 

She has had numerous problems in her life with her health, family, and other problems. Serious problems, she has been on and off anti depressants for. And I always promised myself, if we Wer to breakup it wouldn't be for something that isn't her fault. I always supported her best I could and tried to be her rock. Despite her adversities, she is graduating nursing school and I couldn't be more proud. 

But over these last 2 months, she has been very distant. Hasn't told me she misses me, hasn't come to visit from school, hasn't invited me up. Texts me less, ect. I expressed multiple times how upset it made me and she just went on about how she needs to be selfish to see her friends before she graduates college. It got to the point where I told her maybe we shouldn't be together multiple times. And then she agreed and we brokeup for a day or 2 and stopped talking completely. And both really sad from the cutoff, got back together. She asked for another chance and I figured she deserved it, despite people telling me otherwise i shouldn't. Although she hasn't been good, I didn't think she did anything unforgivable, and I have also made my mistakes that she has let me come back from.  She said she would do better and I took her back. 

A few days later I took off from work to go see her on her birthday and I asked if I should drive up to her school and she told me she's busy hanging out with her friends during the day and then at night with her family. Which is odd considering she hung out with them 3 days in a row and I get along with all her friends and am basically part of her family. I bugged out about not being invited and went out that night with my friends. The next day we had a really nice talk and mutually agreed to end it with love and respect for Eachother despite everything. 

A day or 2 later we talk to check up on Eachother and she is histerical crying. Ends up begging me to let her have another chance. Telling me she will do anything to earn another chance, will always treat me better and how she used to. Ect ect. Really heartfelt, and I do truly believe she's not bullshitting. And I do understand she was having problems coming off her anti depressants and trying to fill the void with drinking.  But I do believe I gave her enough chances here. 

I do miss her and wish we could be together happy but a lot of damage was done, my family who for the most part always liked her, is advising me not to get back. And for those few days We Wer apart I was sad when I thought of her, but also felt relieved to be single again. And relieved I'm not unhappy in the relationship anymore. 

So here I am, truthfully if she wasn't so sad and dedicated to me I would be fine going seperate ways for now. But it does bother me a lot to see her upset. I do care for her and although I'm still bothered by her selfishness, I do sympathize with her and forgive her mistakes. I do almost think though this is my chance to be single and I should take it. But I do love her and care about her feelings maybe even more than mine. Side note I have no suspicion at all of cheating, that's basically out of the equation to her. And I do trust she would make it better. But I'm not sure if it's worth it at this point, and it's not like we always got along perfect, the love and helped us through, our personalities don't always flow greatly. 

TLDR - loving and caring gf of 2 years became very neglectful for 2 months, brokeup for 2 days, didn't change, brokeup again, and is now pulling out all the stops to get me back. I think maybe being single is a good move for me right now, but I also consider her feelings","['23_m', 'need', 'advice', '21_f', 'gf', 'ex', 'gf', 'long', 'detailed', 'post', 'hey', 'guy', 'go', 'to', 'decently', 'long', 'descriptive', 'post', 'appreciate', 'input', 'girl', '2', 'year', '4', 'month', 'day', 'ago', 'call', 'quit', 'beg', 'majority', 'happy', 'relationship', 'despite', 'beginning', 'worry', 'single', 'fun', '20_', 'eventually', 'get', 'commit', 'hopeful', 'future', 'despite', 'drunk', 'think', 'man', 'wish', 'talk', 'girl', 'ect', 'slight', 'temptation', 'stay', 'faithful', 'happy', 'numerous', 'problem', 'life', 'health', 'family', 'problem', 'problem', 'anti', 'depressant', 'promise', 'wer', 'breakup', 'fault', 'support', 'good', 'try', 'rock', 'despite', 'adversity', 'graduate', 'nursing', 'school', 'proud', '2', 'month', 'distant', 'tell', 'miss', 'come', 'visit', 'school', 'invite', 'text', 'ect', 'express', 'multiple', 'time', 'upset', 'go', 'need', 'selfish', 'friend', 'graduate', 'college', 'get', 'point', 'tell', 'maybe', 'multiple', 'time', 'agree', 'brokeup', 'day', '2', 'stop', 'talk', 'completely', 'sad', 'cutoff', 'get', 'ask', 'chance', 'figure', 'deserve', 'despite', 'people', 'tell', 'good', 'think', 'unforgivable', 'mistake', 'let', 'come', 'say', 'well', 'take', 'day', 'later', 'take', 'work', 'birthday', 'ask', 'drive', 'school', 'tell', 'busy', 'hang', 'friend', 'day', 'night', 'family', 'odd', 'considering', 'hang', '3', 'day', 'row', 'friend', 'basically', 'family', 'bug', 'invite', 'go', 'night', 'friend', 'day', 'nice', 'talk', 'mutually', 'agree', 'end', 'love', 'respect', 'eachother', 'despite', 'day', '2', 'later', 'talk', 'check', 'eachother', 'histerical', 'cry', 'end', 'beg', 'let', 'chance', 'tell', 'earn', 'chance', 'treat', 'well', 'ect', 'ect', 'heartfelt', 'truly', 'believe', 'bullshit', 'understand', 'have', 'problem', 'come', 'anti', 'depressant', 'try', 'fill', 'void', 'drinking', 'believe', 'give', 'chance', 'miss', 'wish', 'happy', 'lot', 'damage', 'family', 'like', 'advise', 'day', 'wer', 'apart', 'sad', 'think', 'feel', 'relieve', 'single', 'relieved', 'unhappy', 'relationship', 'anymore', 'truthfully', 'sad', 'dedicated', 'fine', 'go', 'seperate', 'way', 'bother', 'lot', 'upset', 'care', 'bother', 'selfishness', 'sympathize', 'forgive', 'mistake', 'think', 'chance', 'single', 'love', 'care', 'feeling', 'maybe', 'note', 'suspicion', 'cheating', 'basically', 'equation', 'trust', 'well', 'sure', 'worth', 'point', 'like', 'get', 'perfect', 'love', 'help', 'personality', 'flow', 'greatly', 'tldr', 'love', 'caring', 'gf', '2', 'year', 'neglectful', '2', 'month', 'brokeup', '2', 'day', 'change', 'brokeup', 'pull', 'stop', 'think', 'maybe', 'single', 'good', 'right', 'consider', 'feeling']"

I know posting this will give me a lot of crap as a human being but I need some opinions and just advice on what I can do about my situation.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for nearly 9 months and throughout the relationship, I have been not the very best girlfriend.
I complain a lot, can be a lot to deal with (lashing out at boyfriend when I am stressed and annoyed over something stupid), and always entitled when it comes to boyfriend having to always apologize first.
I give up easily and tend to run away from a lot of things in my life. Whether it is grades (school), career fairs, and relationships.

Whenever I feel insecure or when I feel like the communication isn't there in my relationship, rather than talking it out and doing something about it with him, I always seek the break/break up option. I usually blame myself for majority of the reasons why I feel like it's not working (ie. not putting in the work, saying mean/horrible things to him). I mentioned breaking up with him a couple of times and every time I do this... it breaks him more and more. The trust and love we have is deteriorating. We always mention we are going to get this through together but I always feel like it's not worth it or I feel like I'm being attacked by him when he brings up the things I have said and done to him. I acknowledge every little thing I did/said to him and not very so proud. As much I deserve the reminder, it sometimes discourages me to be more optimistic in changing or gaining his trust. 

But all in all, I want to earn his trust back. We argue a lot about the same things which makes me feel like there's never much progress and I seek to run away. 
I know I can earn his trust by not being so mean and being more patient with him but I feel like I should do something more. But not sure. I know it might take months, years or decades to earn his trust even by a little. We talk about the future a lot and he still wants us to stay together and work it out every time I threatened him I'm going to leave. 

I know I messed up. I need help and currently seeking out a counseling to work out why I am the way I am. 
Stories or advice would be greatly appreciated on how to mend a relationship in my perspective. I am not looking for a new foundation but something I know would lead to something stable.
I always thought of trust as a piece of paper. As the paper crumples up from hurtful words and actions, it can never be the same. 

I want to show him I am worthy for him and I can be the person he fell in love with.

369,8k0gx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k0gx5/i_29m_was_a_very_late_bloomer_and_i_dont_know_if/,I [29M] was a very late bloomer and I don't know if what I feel for my gf [25F] is close to normal,"Short backstory: I grew up in a very positive religious home (honestly just a very warm loving family who had the best intentions) and I didn't really date/have sex until turning 27. Fast forward a couple of years and I gained some experience (10 short term partners, 2 that lasted a few months). Thus, I don't feel like I've had the traditional maturing stages of ""date in HS, sex in college, a few girlfriends along the way"". Moreover, I really got used to be happy just being alone and doing things solo (or with a few close friends).

Present day: I'm dating a very kind girl who likes all my nerdy quirks. Usually dating is tough for me because girls don't seem to like these quirks, but we had a great time right off the bat. Normally, I'm so focused on getting another date that I usually don't really considered what would happen if a girl wanted to have a relationship with me. In this case, she brought it up while we were both really drunk and I said ""well we might as well since I'm not seeing anyone else"". 

So once the relationship began, it felt like something in me changed. While sounding cold-hearted, it kind of felt like I had just won a video game or read a book. Now that I had gotten her to like me, the challenge was over and I didn't feel so good about it. She was all excited that we were now going out (she apparently found herself usually rejecting guys) and she made things really go too fast for me. I met her brother right away and her parents a week later when they were in town. All nice people, but I always thought those things should come once you really know a person well (like months down the line). 

My previous (and only other) ""girlfriend"" really got upset when I didn't do things like bring her flowers or say ""I love you"", so this time I decided to avoid any possible screaming/tears by going along with the flow. While I always figured my emotions could catch up and I could avoid any friction along the way, I'm still waiting to feel something ""extra special"".

It's been 4 months since we became ""official"" and she is so head over heels excited, that I feel guilty that I'm not at her level. Not that I don't think I could feel those things too, I just really don't feel them yet. On top of that, she's feeling more comfortable with me and now she answers honestly when I ask her how things are going (sadly the answer is ""terrible day"" everyday and ""you're my only bright spot"")

So a few things:
1) Is it common for someone in the early stages of a relationship to be way more committed than the other?
2) Does loving someone really make you feel giddy when you're out of hormone raging teen/early-20s age? (a few friends have said they don't really feel the way they did 10 years ago about love anymore)
3) Does this sound like a healthy relationship or something that's like a slow moving train wreck? Are there any tell-tale signs I seem to be missing? 

I'm sorry for the long post. Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read and answer any of my questions! So grateful!

371,8k0e96,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k0e96/ldr_girlfriend_wants_space_and_has_been_more/,Ldr girlfriend wants space and has been more distant,"A bit about myself. This is my first relationship. I tend to be jealous and have anxiety/overthinking issues.

We started dating a bit over month ago. The first 3 weeks were amazing, we would call almost the whole time every day, fall asleep together, wake up together. But about 2 weeks ago she asked for space. She told me that she's an introverted person and just needs space sometimes. I asked for how long she said it can be from 2 hours to 2 days. Basically the first 2 days I completely messed up, I was being extremely clingy and not letting her be. Then by the end of the 2nd day I calmed down. When I asked her to call on the 3rd day, she said she was too tired. And basically for the next few days she was bringing up different reasons why she can't talk, like I'm too tired, I need alone time, I have school and work etc. At that time we still called once per day before sleep. But I was still extremely anxious and thought that something was wrong, so I told her that I miss her and I feel like she doesn't like me anymore. She told me to trust her and that she would tell me if her feelings faded, but they haven't. Basically I still didn't leave completely alone for the next few days and kept asking for calls. I told her a few more times that it hurts to be away from her like that, she said she understands and that she will try to be less tired and talk to me more. Also, this whole time period she was acting a lot more distant. She used to send me messages that she loves me and she's glad I do things for her etc. but that pretty much stopped. She still said that she loves me too when I said good night I love you but that's about it. Skip to the 6th day, Saturday. I called her and we were in a call all day but she didn't seem very talkative and I thought something was wrong so I asked if she's okay and didn't talk too much either. Then, on Sunday I messaged her again that I'm worried etc and I guess we got into an argument. She said that I don't trust her enough and that she's becoming even more distant because were having this conversation all the time and she's tired of it. But even in that conversation she told me different reasons like I'm too tired, too busy or antisocial, even though this whole time she still played and talked with her friends for about 2 hours per day, but she didn't call me. So by the end of the argument she came to the conclusion that when we have long calls I don't plan stuff enough and that's part of the reason why she wanted to start having alone time. I told that would change and we settled the argument. I asked her if she wanted to call before sleep but she said that her earbuds broke so she can't. Now, for the past 3 days I haven't really bothered her and we haven't called, because she said she's getting new ones in 2 days, on Friday. For the record we still text for most of the day. She has also stopped sending me snapchats because she feels ""ugly"". I've always been telling her that she's beautiful and perfect to me no matter what but I guess it didn't work. Last time I called her cute she got annoyed because I say it too much.

Basically, I'm worried because she's been so distant. I realize that I messed up a lot, especially towards the start because of my overthinking. I've been extremely anxious for the past 2 weeks, constantly worried that she just doesn't like me anymore. I feel somewhat unappreciated because I would use every moment I had to talk to her, stay up until 7 in the morning to fall asleep together with her. It hurts when I think that she doesn't miss me as I miss her. And she does tell me that she misses me, it's just that she's too busy. But I feel like she's not even trying to talk to me right now. Even when she's home she's always too tired to talk to me but not to play with her friends. I've only gotten 1 night of decent sleep in the past 2 weeks and I'm constantly anxious, it's driving me nuts.

I guess I just need some recommendations on what to do. The past 3 days I've been doing better, I guess partly because I realized that there's no point in forcing her but partly because there's a reason we can't talk since her earbuds are broken(I don't even know if I should question this or not but I'm trying not to). I think right now I just need to keep it going, but it's hard because I keep thinking about it the whole time and can't sleep properly or do anything properly because of it. Should I be this worried? Should I trust her? She tells me that she will tell me when she gets new earbuds and that overall she calls whenever she can. It's just painful for me to see that she's home, playing with her friends but not talking to me at all, and it's been like this for almost 2 weeks now.

Sorry if this post is a mess, I'm just mentally weak right now and need help asap. I don't want to show her that I'm weak or depend on her anymore.

I wasn't a great partner throughout our relationship - never made any concrete long term plans with her, took our intimacy for granted a lot of times, and generally just didn't do enough to make her feel loved. 

The worst of it was that in my time alone, I sometimes found myself looking at and searching provocative photos of other girls, many of whom we knew personally, and even downloaded some of the photos for future ""reference"". It was a shameful habit and I did all I could to keep this dirty secret to myself yet I never did anything solid to curb it. I stopped after we got married but never came clean about it.

A few months into the marriage, my wife started investigating my internet accounts through my old laptop that we now shared and found my search history for the last several years. Needless to say, this dealt a severe blow to her self-esteem and our marriage and completely changed the way she saw me. We went through cycle after cycle of fighting, depression, and were on the brink of separating at several points. We went through couple's therapy, but while it helped us in some aspects, it could only do so much. And just a month ago, with the help of a data recovery tool, she uncovered photos I had downloaded and previously deleted. She knew nothing about the downloading until this point. Now we've been thrown back into the same toxic cycle and I'm afraid we're back at square one, if not worse.

After this incident, I've come clean to everything I did behind her back while we were still in a relationship and we're committing to make an effort to move forward. But as much as I'd like to leave the past behind completely, I know it can't be done until my wife's self-esteem is rebuilt and her trust in me restored.

I'd like to do something grand to make her see how much she means to me and help her build her self esteem again. Even small, everyday things would help, though with my track record, small things are now much less believable to her.

Any ideas I can try out?

373,8k07z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k07z9/moving_in_together_but_i_have_doubts/,"Moving in together, but I have doubts","I(23F) have been dating my boyfriend(23) for almost 4 years now. He graduates college this summer and I am starting a master's program in the fall. We plan to move in together after my lease is up July 31. 

I am having some major doubts about whether or not I should be moving in with him. I have had my own apartment the entire time we have been dating and he has lived in school dorms usually without roommates. 

The most pressing issue that is causing my doubts is that when he comes over to my apartment on weekends, holidays etc., he causes a huge mess and he NEVER cleans up after himself. I have asked him multiple times to clean up before he leaves, to help me clean while he is here, or even to just wash the dishes and I will clean everything else. His response is usually something like ""I'm a guest"", ""I'm on break I want to relax"", or ""can we clean up later""(only to be followed up by another excuse later). The few times he does clean up has been the coffee table because he's about to eat or the counters and a few dishes when he's going to cook(but never cleans up after he's done).  

I work sooo much, sometimes 7 days a week and it's added stress to come home to a bigger mess everyday that wouldn't be there if he weren't here. I don't want to act like my apartment is always spotless because it's not, but I at least keep it clean enough for someone to come over without being embarrassed. I actually had to talk my mom (who i never get to see☹) out of a visit because I knew it was a mess and I wouldn't get home in time to clean.

The takeaway is, I'm afraid that I will move in with him and regret it after a week, especially with all the stress of grad school coming my way. He insists that he would clean up after himself if he lived here, but he doesnt feel it's his responsibility at my place(come on, I've seen his dorm room). I can just imagine him having excuses about how he's tired from work(the way I've been since graduating 1.5 years ago).I have a cat and dog who already make messes like kids, I don't need a 3rd weight on my back.

Would really appreciate some mature and insightful advice. 

Have been together with my girlfriend for 3 years and have been living together for most of that time. 

We both feel we have a strong connection. As recently as today she said I'm the only person she can be herself around, I'm the only person she can tell anything to. And she's told me everything. Every bad regretful thing she's done. Every feeling. Even how she feels about her ex... 

Who she has a six year old son with. Our relationship, I think, would have been amazing up until now if it wasn't for her ex. She broke up with me Monday night, and had sex with him only hours later. 

I begged her to tell me. So she admitted it. My fear all these years was that I would lose her to him. For context, he's not a good man. He's threatened her, harrassed her, berated her, etc. He's trash. But every so often he fools her. And she falls for it. This is the first time they slept together since I've been with her, but they kissed once before. We broke up for a couple weeks then as well. 

The odd thing is.. When she kissed him, had sex with him, I never got angry. I never yelled at her. Never insulted. I always tried to understand her motives. 

She has different sides to her. She recently started taking medication (a month ago or so) for bipolar disorder. She is often sad and depressed. A tragic soul sort of speak. She's experienced a lot of loss, more than most for her age. 

She has always felt immense guilt for only having her son 50% of the time. A lot of people live that way, and still have healthy loyal relationships with people other than their co-parent. She can't seem to get there. 

I went to our house today to get some things, where she's currently staying, and it was like nothing ever happened. I mean, we cried and recognized the chaos that was created and the loss we both feel. But we embraced and held one another. We still love each other dearly. 

Unfortunately our friends and family would kill us if we got back together. So I can't just go back. Not that way so soon. I suggested we still see each other, but gain some independence, still hang out with her son (who basically feels like my son now, he adores me), and that I would get my own apartment in a couple/few months and be together under the family/friends radar. Not to hide in an unhealthy way, but to trial it before publicly celebrating it. 

I realize her ex will always be in the picture. But the extent of that is within her control. She's always sort of left the door open for him a tad. Never fully whole heartedly committed to me. But I truly don't think it's because she loves him. And I know for certain he doesn't love her. We've gone to the police and lawyers about him before. He's a poor excuse of a man. 

I keep trying to tell her she needs to let go of the past. She stews in it. She calls herself a monster and a piece of shit. I tell her she's just a flawed human being like the rest of us. She's not evil. 

I guess what I'm asking is... Can this work? I'm not even sure what will convince me that she's finally put him behind her. I mean, I proposed this option today... She's almost lost me a couple of times. To me, she should be considering herself lucky and telling him immediately that they are done for good etc. But she needs time to think about it. 

All I know is, as cliche as it sounds, I can't be without her and her son. This isn't my first relationship. And I had a longer term one. I broke up and ghosted the last one for cheating on me with their ex (!).

376,8k050h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8k050h/im_finally_single_after_a_very_long_time_and/,I'm finally single after a very long time and struggling with it,"Greeting reddit fellows,

I don't know where and who to tell this long story. This may be the best way for me to pull this out of my stomach. It's quite long and I hope you can bare with me.

I'm 26 years old, been through a lot of relationship since I was 16. 10 years with 7 relationships, this is not a impressive number, this just shows how unstable I am and I feel bad about it. I always want to be in a serious and committing relationship. As I get older, the urge to find a soulmate and marry her eventually becomes bigger and bigger.

I just broke up with my girlfriend 2 months ago. This is the longest time I've been single since I don't know when. I jumped into new ones pretty quickly after a breakup. That relationship lasted over 1 year with a lot of ups and downs. About 3 months ago, I found out that she cheated on my, twice, with a same guy. That broke me into many pieces but I still tried to forgive her since I wasn't a complete good guy in the past, I just wanted to be a mature man rather than blaming her. Time flied, we were happy for a short while but things got complicated, it lead to the breakup and actually, it was simple, she asked to break up with me and I just said yes, things were done, no fights, no yelling. I'm happy that it happened because we no longer belong to each other. I felt like it was a burden when I had to talk to her every night after a long tired day and she felt empty if I didn't talk to her much. It just didn't work out for both of us, I could not feel it anymore. Shortly after the break up, I learned that she got a new boyfriend who is the guy she cheated with when she was with me. Again, I'm happy that it happened because sooner or later, if she could cheat on me twice, she could do it again and again.

Being single has a lot of perks, I can do whatever I want, go wherever I want, I can sleep anytime and play games anytime. I've been enjoying it. But slowly, the mourning period hit me. Lonely nights come and bug me, thoughts spinning around my head. I tried to find someone but I felt I wasn't ready for anything too serious, for now. I have to admit that with a guy who has barely been single for years like me, it's quite hard to be single and have noone to talk to at night. I'm used to talking with someone every night whether it's a long or short conversation. 

And I found out another problem, I don't know how to talk to a girl. I don't know how I got into those relationships, it was quite easy for me but now, I have no idea to talk to a girl. The fear of being neglected hits me really hard, I don't know how to greet a girl or start a conversation long enough to draw her attention. It's like a crisis to me after the break up. And sometimes my brain just recalls the old memories just to torture me in the middle of the night. I've been dealing with it, as much as I'm tired, I'm happy that I can still be positive to find a girl to talk to. It's just I can't seem to find a way to get out of the crisis.

We had been living together for a whole year before this already and I thought we were on the same page about interior design and what we wanted our first apartment to be like. I was mistaken.

 I spent most of the day today trying to figure out what smaller items I want to  pack up and take with us. He spent most of the day telling me we don't need to take my stuff.

He only wants the bare minimum in our apartment, and I want our apartment to feel cozy and inviting. He likes fuctional order and I like a little colorful chaos. I'm already toning myself down a lot to make it a mixture of both, and I've tried explaining my vision of our apartment, but he can't see it and still wants me to leave behind so much stuff. I plan on taking my stuff anyway because I know he won't fight me over it or anything and that these things will be used, but I just want to know how I can get him to stop being so uptight and borderline lazy with what we put in our apartment. It's like he just wanted the roof over our heads and not the work it takes to make it into a home.

Tl;dr: I want to decorate our new apartment. My boyfriend would rather it be plain, with only furniture and functional items. He wants me to leave behind a ton of stuff I like.

Myself (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been together almost two years now. I suffer and have being suffering with anxiety and depression for years. We've broken up twice because of my mental health causing issues ie being too much on him (which is completely understandable) and driving me to suicidal thoughts. 

I've had a pretty tough life, I left home at 16 because of abuse from my step dad and essentially became homeless. The last two years have been really difficult for me.

In December last year, I attempted to take my life. We had had a really bad argument, i had spent the last two months depressed and alone laying in bed because no motivation and we hardly see eachother because he works shift work and neither of us drive and my life was going nowhere and I was living in a shitty shared house run by the council.

He of course took it badly and I didn't realise how much my mental health had affected him, and I am unbelievably sorry for that. And I want to support him with what he needs etc. 
We broke up in December but he wanted to get back together and work things out properly and try again. So we did however he didn't want to tell his family yet or make it public because he was worried we might not stay together. That's fair enough so I agreed to it. 

Fast forward six months, I've been great bar the last few weeks where I've had violent house mates so my PTSD and anxiety have been a little bad. But I have a great job, I'm planning on going back to college and he's decided to buy a flat later on in the year and have me move into it. He still doesn't want to tell his family. I agree he needs time to deal with things but it does eat at me a little. Today we went out into town and we had lunch at a cafe, holding hands over the table and chatting etc. When his dad and brother walk past and he just snatched his hands away as if I had some sort of disease. And when I went quiet and was upset, he got angry at me. 

Anytime I bring it up, and try and talk about how it all makes me feel, he gets angry with me and tells me that it's my fault because of my attempted suicide that it's like this. Despite all of my efforts to amend it and show I'm doing better now and trying my hardest. He doesn't seem to understand how hurtful it all is and how it makes me feel like he's ashamed of me. 

Am I overthinking/being overly anxious or unreasonable? I don't expect him to tell his parents if he's still uncomfortable but it's been six months, he won't let me talk about how it makes me feel, blames me for it and gets angry with me about it. But he's happy to buy a property for me to live in. 


TDLR: Long term relationship ended six months ago but got back together after my attempted suicide. He doesn't want to tell family we are back together but won't discuss the topic at all or how it makes me feel and gets angry at me if I try and tells me it's all my fault.

I didn’t even know what to say to this shit and when I didn’t answer she proceeded to blow up my phone and Facebook. She is just a complete cluster fuck of a person and I don’t know what to do about it anymore. It’s super embarrassing to me and my husband because her parents bring her over to family events and out in public and she acts like a mentally insane child. My parents have asked me multiple times what’s wrong with her and recently she had a complete breakdown including cursing and laying on the ground screaming at a family event in front of my old-school German grandmother because she wanted a second dessert and it was all gone. It was absolutely mortifying. About 6 months ago she pushed my father in law (who has bad knees) down the stairs because he told her to clean her room. My husband was understandably pissed and went over to the house to tell her to keep her hands off their parents and she kicked him in the shin, then fell down and screamed that he hit her and ran up to her room where she proceeded to throw shit and destroy the house. We told his parents she was not welcome at our house or around us again but slowly they have started bringing her around again and I don’t know what to do. If it was my own sister I would call the police and have her ass committed but I am at an utter loss here. Help.

April 28, 2014  : I experienced the most unendurable feeling of a broken heart, 19 years old at the time. My  motivation to look for partner since then es drastically diminished. 

April 28, 2018 : I happen to know a girl over chat app “soul” while studying at Starbucks. As name suggests, this app place users into a network that has similar character trait based on the answers chosen by users during app questionnaire.  Although it does connect people closer than usual chat app, I still feel she may probably not be the other part of my lost soul. Luckily she is in London studying in 3rd year and I’m in Cologne studying in 1st year, we are both Chinese. It’s 90min flight between 2 locations,  I wanted to fly to her to test our chemistry, but our chat until so far has gone unilateral. she used to reply me as long as I texted her something, but she started to replace them with emoji and simple words. But so far I have’t unveiled my fondness of her because I don’t want to make her feel like she’s being threatened by a pursuer, our conversation involves everything other than romance.

The ground backing my intention : i fear to not learn how to manage a relationship, and I should do it as early as possible because people will find it harder change bad habits as people age. Bad habits that impedes developing good relationship. 

Am I being just naive or should I just simply focus on managing my own life well first? Im 2 year older than her, by she will enter the world of work earlier than me definitely because I had some gap years. it is worth my time, money and energy learning what criteria a girl from a likely prestige family ( according to her dressing code and lifestyle embodies through her social media posts ) demand from a dream lover?

At a very young age, I was also taken advantage of by an older male. Due to this, I have a natural distrust of men.

While I have never experienced a crush before, I was always confident in my identity as a lesbian. Simply because I didn't trust guys.

...Until recently. One of my friends introduced me to his friend a few months back. We jokingly flirted, him knowing I was a lesbian, and then jokes spouting up about how my friend likes to go after women he can't get.

This was fine. I didn't mind this. I thought it was fun, I liked jokingly flirting with him.

...And then I met him face to face. Our mutual friend introduced us via a chat client. So when I met him face to face, I wasn't sure what I was expecting.

And what I got: a dreamboat of a guy, shoulders wide and stomach soft (just how i like it!!). Dreamy, deep brown eyes and..well, I..kinda felt like he was perfect.

And then a week ago us and our mutual friends all met up for a get together. Because we jokingly flirted, we were automatically very affectionate with each other. IE, hugs, hand-holding, and him grabbing my face and rubbing his beard scruff against my face.

And since then I have been faced with a dilemma: I. Have. a MAJOR crush on the dude. And I have no idea what to do!

He's also a serial flirt. He flirts with a LOT of women. So I think, in a way, I also use my confusion to do with my sexuality as a way to distance myself from him; avoiding any chance of getting hurt just in case.

But I can't help but want to get close to him. He has such a nice, soothing voice and he smells like comfort. He's so warm and good and nice and I...

am dubbed the world's worst lesbian.

I have no idea what to do anymore, I'm so confused and scared; I feel like I shouldn't chase him because...what if this is just the way he is?

This bothered me the very first time I met with his parents and he told me ""just say we met through a mutual friend or something"" but I didn't think of it much then.

I brought it up recently since I am not okay with lying for the rest of my life over something that I should be proud/happy over? and demanded a real answer, met with ""I'm uncomfortable with it"" which was not good enough an answer/more like excuse to me. (It felt like he is embarrassed over how we met: online via a video game chat room)

Wanting to bring this up and talk about it to ""communicate through this problem"" after some prodding and poking, he answered with ""why can't you just say we met online and that's it"" which I compromised and agreed with, but I still wanted a solid answer as to why he was uncomfortable. Met with ""why can't you just let me say I'm uncomfortable with certain things and let it be, you always ask more and make me even more uncomfortable about it, and every time you bring something up to ""talk about"" I feel like ""oh I've failed, what did I fuck up this time"" which baffled me. I told him not to feel that way because how else are we supposed to talk out our problems? But apparently bringing up anything stresses him out and makes him feel like a failure.

Ultimately I got an answer saying ""you know what you tell people whatever you want but when it comes to MY side of family and friends we say online. My family doesn't understand gaming, they hate it, don't accept it and that's it""

That to me was a real, acceptable answer. It still bugs me but I'm willing to work with this..

I went through a really rough time last year and turned to alcohol to numb the pain. My dog died, my grandma who raised me died, my auntie died, a friend went missing and was found murdered, lost my job because of a medical issue which I had a surgery for that left me bed ridden for about 3 months.

I got drunk one night and said some really hurtful stuff to my ex. Said he had jacked up hair, and fucked up teeth and smelt like piss. Told him I hated his best friend and that I hope they'd die in car fire together... Just really hateful stuff. He knew I was black out drunk and whatever and I know that's not an excuse....

Well I stopped drinking and got my shit together (4 months). I messaged him and apologized and he's responded back and now is asking me to prove myself to him by holding a job and going to school...  I'm just really pissed off cause I was doing those things and everything was going fine till I lost my mind when my life fell apart with all the loss... tbh who wouldn't be fucked up after loosing their parent and a friend being murdered THEN having surgery and being stuck in bed for 3 months. 

His life hasn't changed since we first me. No one he knew died, never lost his job, perfect health. So what the fuck does he know. 

I do love him, but maybe I'm being blinded by love.

Weird for me to be asking around here, but I'm in a dilemma. I don't know if I should let this relationship continue...

-In a relationship I'm 23, she's 22. The relationship is about 4 months old.

-I've been in a relationship before and she pretty much hasn't.

-She's a virgin but she is also really satisfied and confident about her own body

-We live 35 minutes in car apart.

-Edit: She's giving me attention, and craves mine back. So it's not like she doesn't care about me.


The relationship is a bit complicated because my girlfriend and I 
haven't had proper sex yet, and I've received 0 sexual pleasure myself. I haven't been inside her yet because she is unnaturally tight. At our first attempt I couldn't even get a SINGLE finger inside, that was how bad it was. I'm now able to get 2 fingers up, so we're getting closer, but it's still super tedious and has caused some problems already. 

I will go down on her and get her to climax twice, yet she will hardly touch my penis! She'll only touch it if I guide her hand down onto it? I would obviously like her to do for me what I do to her, but she says that she isn't ready for that. I've already talked to her and made sure that we can learn as we go along, so we've established a non-judgemental sexual environment, but she still isn't ready.

We see each other 2-3 times a week, and I am always the one engaging to have sex. Recently she's started to say no, either because she is too tired, or not in the mood. Which I get. She doesn't have the same high sex drive as I do, but I still think it is early in a relationship? This results in maybe 1 attempt of sex each week, which really makes me frustrated. I feel like I'm boiling over. I want the relationship to move forward sexually. I want her to engage in sex, and I want her to pleasure me as well! She wants to have proper sex first however she says, but how can she demand the ordinary ""procedure"", when we're in this really unordinary situation? I feel like she is really selfish, or perhaps she isn't sufficiently turned on by me? Which maybe explains why she doesn't touch my body at all? Thinking clearly about it 
makes it sound really miserable. Are some girls just like that?

But I don't get why she would want to be with me then? We're otherwise having a really good time together, but when it comes to sexually physical engagement, there's nothing coming my way.

To make matters worse, I'll be the one engaging the sex when we're together, and she'll be turning me down. This has already resulted in some arguments, which I think is an even bigger turn off since I come off as being whiny.

And I'm confused about my sexuality,"I recently met a guy online we have gotten to know each other he is three years older than me and I said I love him and he said he loved me he is bi and I don't know who I am yet if I like guys or girls or both btw I'm just a teen girl every one around me knows who they are and I just feel lost and confused at times I feel like I love girls but I am not ok anthying sexual with them but at times I like guys and think I am ok doing sexual things with them but then later I get repulsed I'm constantly confused as of who I am.

And I can't really explore either due to my mother like long story short she got hurt by a lot of men in her life her phsyche is all messed up and if i date a guy I'll become a whore and a slut and losing my virginity to him will be me losing my 'purity' her mental state is so fucked up she thinks invisible people are fucking me and my brother and is so oveprotective of me because I am a girl with a hole and she is racist to white people and if I date anyone who's not my race I'm instantly like those hookers to her she constantly shames young couples in front of me and if I date a girl I would be humiliated by everyone in my family and probably kicked out of the house if I told her when I was younger and learnt how my dad raped and abused my mom I never wanted to date any one and wanted to stay single and not have kids and I promised myself that but now I just started to fall for a guy. And I remember how three of my oldest cousins who dated their partners were secretly shamed and gossiped about how they are bad for not getting an arranged marriage (my family is muslim but im agnostic) and how they lost their virginities before marriage and are like 'white people'. My mom has started to doubt me running away fucking tons of 'white' guys and becoming a whore and her getting insulted by her family and religious community and its becoming so much of a problem where I have to hide stuff from her and pretend to be this different person for her she tells me 'share your feelings with me dear why won't you?!' And at times I feel like running away and never looking back but I can't I have no one to go to for help if i did. No relatives no friends nothing and...she said to me a few times 'the only reason why I continue to live is because of you and your brother and the only reason i left his terror (my fathers abuse and rage) was because of both of you and if you left me then...I don't know what I'll do' I don't know how to tell her anything anymore she is so stubborn with her oppinions she would hate me if she found who I truly am and my feelings and me wanting to date and growing and exploring who I am. I don't know how to approach her and tell things to her anymore with her taking it seriously and not over reacting

And on the other hand I never felt any love romantically for someone until him but sometimes I push him back and he is sweet he accepts me for who I am if I'm fat skinny short or dark skinned he said he still loves me for who I am but at times I can't accept that he does if I did.

My mum and dad split before I was born. I only really remember seeing him a handful of times and contact stopped when I was 8. 

I hadn't seen him for 13 years until last October, I reached out and made contact. I had nothing to lose. I have another amazing (step) dad. But I also needed answers.i had my mums side of things. I needed his. 

So for the last 8 months we've been meeting once a week at a coffee shop. Never just me and him his partner is always there. Which I really don't mind. If she wasn't there I'd literally have no one to talk to. 

The first couple of times he was really chatty. Now he sits on his phone or takes work calls. He never really asks any questions to try and get to know me. 
He has two other children that don't know about me and his other halfs parents don't know about me. I have to question why since they've been together since I was one. 

Now it's getting on for two weeks and there's been no contact since I last seen him. He isn't answering my calls or texts. 

Should I just accept the fact he doesn't want to know me?  Or am I just being paranoid and seeing more into all this?","['handle', 'thing', 'father', 'feel', 'like', 'post', 'forever', 'include', 'try', 'short', 'possible', 'mum', 'dad', 'split', 'bear', 'remember', 'see', 'handful', 'time', 'contact', 'stop', '8', 'see', '13', 'year', 'october', 'reach', 'contact', 'lose', 'amazing', 'step', 'dad', 'need', 'answers.i', 'mum', 'thing', 'need', '8', 'month', 'meet', 'week', 'coffee', 'shop', 'partner', 'mind', 'literally', 'talk', 'couple', 'time', 'chatty', 'sit', 'phone', 'take', 'work', 'call', 'ask', 'question', 'try', 'know', 'child', 'know', 'halfs', 'parent', 'know', 'question', 'get', 'week', 'contact', 'see', 'answer', 'call', 'text', 'accept', 'fact', 'want', 'know', 'paranoid', 'see']"

I ended up looking at the BFs Instagram to try and gain perspective on them. Found out I have a mutual friend with both of them. So I reached out to her to see what she knew about them.

It went: Hey Sara, Weird question do you know Zack and Reid. “Ya I do! How do you?” Well I really only know Reid... “Stay away, they are such a mess” How so? “Well Reid cheated on him awhile ago, told me about it, so I told zack. She doesn’t know he knows” 

So the girl I slept with ended up with gossiping to her friend, who in turn told the boyfriend. Apparently he is now cheating on her with lots of people, and she doesn’t know. And the reason she was cheating was she felt unsatisfied sexually. Which makes sense from our post romp conversation. I’ve been tested since and I’m in the clear. There are lots of more details but I just figured I would update. My advice don’t trust people on tinder. I will be hanging around if anyone has questions.

403,8jy6vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jy6vb/i_42m_have_been_fwb_with_exwife_36f_for_almost_2/,I [42/M] have been FWB with ex-wife [36/F] for almost 2 years - best way forward to closure,"My ex-wife comes from a well heeled but very traditional southern family. When I lost my job two years ago, her father gave her an ultimatum. Leave and then divorce me, or be cut off financially. Well she chose to leave. We had been having financial struggles for a while. We had a new baby at the time, I had recently transferred from graduate school (late bloomer) and was in a job where my talent was recognized, but it was a long term contract position with no move to permanent. But I assured her I was committed to doing whatever I needed to secure income.

After her family moved her things out, she began telling me that she loved me but was no longer ""in love"" with me. It was the most trying and difficult time in my life, but I will spare those details now about losing time with my young almost 2 year old daughter and the dog too. 

Sometime after moving in with her parents, she came over to go through some of the things she left behind. Somehow something happened and we ended up sleeping together. We were still living only a few miles apart then which made it easy for her to make visits. When her parents went out of town, she had me spend the night and more would happen then. I didn't mind spending the night because it was nice to be with her and my daughter together again if only for a short while. 

Fast forward a year and they move almost 40 miles away. I nearly kill myself keeping up with contract jobs with long commutes, freelance work, and driving over an hour to see my daughter. The hook ups continue to happen when her parents leave and I spend the night (we're too old to be sneaking around). 

For the first year or so I would ask her how much I need to make, and where her feelings lie. All the time I think I'm ready to move on, but something happens and I get attached to the idea of getting back together again; especially when my daughter clearly enjoys seeing us together. 

Recently, things have changed. She recently told me that her parents said that if she ever went back to me they would completely cut her off. She let on that things might change if she finishes her doctorate program which they are helping to finance.

She had been telling me she loved me, but that's been changing over the last couple of weeks. Today I went over thinking we were going to have an afternoon hook-up. After massaging her shoulders a while she said point blank that we weren't having sex, before I said anything or made any moves. I asked her to not be easy on me - to just let me know the blunt brutal truth. She said she didn't know but repeated that she loved me but was not 'in love' with me. She said she was about 50/50 on loving me not loving me. I merely wanted to know if she had any attraction at all and that I could adjust if she didn't. When I tell her the things I would do, like leaving my current PhD program and employment for a higher paying opportunity, she confirms that my financial situation makes it hard to even consider getting back together with me.

I've been on this roller coaster for two years and to be healthy and productive I need the ride to end somehow. I've tried to get her to open up and do the hard work and admit she is no longer attracted to me, but she waffles. I want peace of mind, and I want to move on and not sit around waiting and wondering, but I want somehow to leave an opening for her if she changes her mind. 

How do I move forward?

TL;DR - My (ex)wife left two years ago and we've been FWB the whole time. We sneak around and hide it, and she tells me she loves me but is not 'in love' with me. She won't say whether we can or will get back together, but hints that my financial situation may have something to do with it. How do I find peace and closure, and still leave a door open?

(x-post),"My sister and I recently found out from my aunt that my mom has been having an affair for multiple years with a guy who was working on our house. We always thought they were weirdly close, but never thought it was going this far. My mom is a generally kind person and religious. We thought it was just her generally flirtatious and funny nature. Anyways, we find this out from my aunt a couple months ago, who had been keeping it a secret because she knows it would destroy the family. My sister and I are now torn on what to do with this information.

We both think that it needs to end, and that my dad has a right to know. Our aunt thinks it would lead to divorce and a mess for the whole family. Not to mention that my dad just lost his best and only surviving friend a couple months ago and his mother last year, so she thinks putting this on him would be too much.

While I understand her point, we worry that if he finds out and then deduces that we knew, it would feel like a horrible betrayal on top of his hurting.

We also think that my mom is being played by this guy. He never finished work on our house, but she let it slide. She apparently bought him a house, and his helping him with his business, plane tickets, seminars, etc. We’ve both had interactions with this guy and always found him to be slimy. So even though we are upset at my mom for the affair, we are concerned for her as well. She has a tendency to want to take care of broken people and then get hurt.

What’s the right move here? Talk to my dad? Confront my mom? Confront the guy? Nothing at all?

My dad has been trying for years to make the relationship work, even though they’ve been married for a long time and the spark has died. He’s tried flowers, and appreciation, kisses and hugs. My mom is never receptive and is often rude to him. Now we know why.

We are both heartbroken and feel a bit betrayed ourselves. I know people have desires and that even good people cheat but it’s strange when you have an idea of your parents in your head and then it’s shattered.

First of all this isn't my real account because I feel extremely ashamed of what I did. I feel like I'm an awful person for what I did and I hate myself. I decided what I had was a sickness and started NoFap a month ago. I lost my best friend and the love of my life so I feel incredibly guilty. We were together for almost 4 year. We never had sex. She just didn't want to have sex because of her beliefs. I respected her said that's ok for me. We did some stuff of course but never had sex. We even had some moments where she craved for sex but I stood my ground said I promised her and didn't do anything. We spent literally every second together and like 6\-7 months ago we spent a night together as we did from time to time. 

This time I wanted her to give me a head, and she did but I couldn't hold my self and came into her mouth which she hated and cursed me at that moment. I tried to say sorry that I couldn't keep myself but she still cursed me. Months passed, and the last time we met as lovers, we went to theater and I tried to kiss her, touch her \(I mean sexually\) etc. I could feel her disturbed but couldn't resist the urge to kiss her. She kinda backed off but I still continued. 

After all that it seemed like she still loves me and you know, I would say there is nothing with our relationship she was happy as usual. A month ago, she said we need a break that I'm so grumpy, never got out of my room for years, so lonely and stuff like that. She said she needed time to think whether she loves me or not. Of course I felt awful and tried to solve our problems for a month. It went like hell and it got worse whenever we spoke. The reason was always the same, I was so grumpy she wasn't sure if she could live with me forever. We met twice after that, first she gave me some of my stuff back cried like hell said she loves me and she'll think. 

Second, we went to concert and she stood her ground, said we will never be together ever again, she can't do with me. We spent a great time after that, danced together, I got drunk, cried like a baby, she sent me home. Now, she left me and says that is the best decision she ever took in her life. She says she is disgusted from me and the reason is that the night we spent months ago and the thing I did. I know, without her consent I shouldn't have done that and I feel awful for that. Yes, I shouldn't have forced her to kiss me in the theater but things happened.

I feel so guilty of what I did to her. I feel so sorry. I believe I disrespected her by doing those things and she knows that and hates me. The last time she texted me she called me rapist many times. And I feel so awful right now. Am I rapist? A bad person? Who am I? I started to hate myself for what I did. Yes I did stupid stuff because I wanted her sexually but I'm so confused whether that would make me a rapist or not. I feel like I lost everything and the reason is just my stupid cock. I ruined a 4 years of relationship. 

We had great times together, but she keeps talking about these bad stuff I did.

What should I do?

Back in the beginning of February, I decided to leave my boyfriend of 1½ years. I had this anxiety that told me I had to leave him to be happy, I've had it for a while, comes and goes. So we had a fight a night and I told him I left him. He was devastated but I wasn't. Already on day two I was completely over it and ready to move on. At least, it felt like it.

In the next few months, we only talked a little because we always seemed to start fighting. I didn't think he was the same and he thought the same of me. Fast forward to today, I was told by him that he started seeing someone new in March. Like, as in a relationship, although not official yet. 

The fucked up part is that my heart broke when I realized that he's seeing someone else. It broke like it has never been broken before. I told him that I really thought it was a good thing because I do, I believe it's amazing if he finds someone else. And that he's happy. But I really am devastated. I only told him that I just thought it was hard. Not that I was literally crying my eyes out and having trouble breathing. Now I wish I never left him. I'm realistic though, so I'm not gonna try anything to get back together. I don't want to ruin things between them.

I just want to know, why do I feel like this? Did I fuck up? I left him, he's been through hell because of it and now I'm at where he was. I haven't cried over the breakup before now. Why is it happening? I told him that I need time to breathe, so we won't talk until Sunday or Monday. But when we do talk, am I allowed to say how devastated I am? Or should I just keep it to myself, so that I don't accidentally ruin anything.

I'm sorry if this post seems selfish, I just don't really know what to do and I could really use some help.","['heartbroken', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'break', 'hi', 'relationship', 'advice', 'beginning', 'february', 'decide', 'leave', 'boyfriend', '1½', 'year', 'anxiety', 'tell', 'leave', 'happy', 'come', 'go', 'fight', 'night', 'tell', 'leave', 'devastate', 'day', 'completely', 'ready', 'feel', 'like', 'month', 'talk', 'little', 'start', 'fight', 'think', 'think', 'fast', 'forward', 'today', 'tell', 'start', 'see', 'new', 'march', 'like', 'relationship', 'official', 'fuck', 'heart', 'break', 'realize', 'see', 'break', 'like', 'break', 'tell', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'believe', 'amazing', 'find', 'happy', 'devastate', 'tell', 'think', 'hard', 'literally', 'cry', 'eye', 'have', 'trouble', 'breathe', 'wish', 'leave', 'realistic', 'go', 'to', 'try', 'want', 'ruin', 'thing', 'want', 'know', 'feel', 'like', 'fuck', 'leave', 'hell', 'cry', 'breakup', 'happen', 'tell', 'need', 'time', 'breathe', 'talk', 'sunday', 'monday', 'talk', 'allow', 'devastated', 'accidentally', 'ruin', 'sorry', 'post', 'selfish', 'know', 'use', 'help']"

I am studying at her university (over 2 months from now).


Things were seemingly suddenly uncertain just before her departure 12 months ago because of sudden number of things on both our parts;


+ She backed out of telling her church-going family about me (though no deal-breaker-maybe partly because of that) because and at that point she ""thought the suspicion is cool""


+ so she understandably spent her birthday with her mom and I had little chance to (do anything or) make anything special.


+ She seemed okay by this this knowing I was going to save up to fly over Christmas (that's ""all she wanted"") All I DID give her was sex.


+ Her and her friends went to the club the night before she left and when I turned up with others she ""what are you doing here?""
This kind of hurt me but I guess I was anxious with her leaving etc


+ Later that night she sensed I could feel a trust issue was real between us and she almost begged for me. I felt guilty but reassured.


+ Within a month of long-distance she wasn't sure about us, needed space and we broke ""although only temporary"".


+ 2 Months in - the space seemed more serious becoming a break. 3 months was basically not together.


+ We both started our next studying semester and after a couple months slowly started reconnecting - and also smoothing out our past quarrels etc. Talking every night or so.


+ It was good, ""I love you-s"" we were practically together.


until we hit a brick wall.


+ November 9th, that weekend I felt we would take it to the next stage - I had a female friend come over because she was ""waiting to go to her friends soon nearby"" she stayed a little late and I got anxious about my (almost) GF calling/having me have to tell her I have a female friend around, late, AND she looks a LOT like her so I would be embarrassed/ashamed her finding out - because it would be a massive THIS IS WHO I WOULD REPLACE YOU WITH AFTER WE WERE OVER type thing. 


+ She did call. I didn't tell her, the conversation was short and didn't go anywhere. I felt I was wrong to prioritize how I did; being ashamed of having that other person around instead of focusing on us that night if it had seen it to be so important for us.


+ The next morning she called-waking me up and I instinctively said ""I feel guilty"" to which she chased up with why etc and before I could even think or get my words straight I realized it meant sounding what I fear and my stupid self had said ""Last night... when you called... there was this girl, that came round..."" (sounding upset and she was obviously in fear of the trust we had built after so long almost abruptly being shattered by me) and I didn't know what to say from there in the moment I just said ""nothing happened"" though she had to ask which hurt me seeing her like this when I envisioned the opposite would be happening that weekend. She followed with questioning ""Who is she?"" abrasively asking her ""What's her name?"" etc - this made me feel 100% that I had done something wrong and all the shame and embarrassment came in like a shot and I just felt like I failed.


Am I wrong?


Fast forward-I still haven't gotten over it.

I felt accused for something I didn't do that I am equally ashamed of.
I don't want this to be the reason I failed.
She was wrong to her ask me her name, right?
This robbed me of my dignity. I was already being vulnerable :/


The worst part is this was 6 MONTHS AGO and we haven't been the same since, I've the same week a chronic/major illness came - a so-far unknown tight pressure in my head that hasn't fully left yet and ringing in my ears constantly 'tinnitus' so I have been terrible to be around anyway.

Which makes it more sad because it's gotten to the point I'm in bed every day avoiding life. It felt like my life spiraled from that.
It's gotten to the point where she says stuff like ""I'm young, I was just want to exist"" etc there's no fun whatsoever between us and I can blame it on the illness and she knows that :/ but it's uncertain. We do talk sometimes and I know somewhere she wants it to work, she reached out on valantine's day etc, but maybe because I'm like this - I don't know how to fix it.
She's currently back in her home-town and plans on 'taking drumming lessons' from a boy she grew up with a crush on each other. I have a feeling they're might/try follow up on that, but who am I to judge/be jealous? I just feel we're mature - at the same time helpless.

I sent her a big box of gifts last week (for her birthday) She said ""it's sweet"" The last thing I want is for it to feel forced. We don't owe each other anything.

He used to walk to work but now has to drive and pay for parking. 

We have a happy as healthy relationship.

He recently bought a new car which he cares for meticulously. He seems loathe to drive it to work as does not want to scratch the alloys and is reluctant to pay for parking.

I drive a main part of my job. Boyfriend has been asking for lifts to work since we moved. I’ve given the odd lift here and there but often am going to sites away from my main office and dropping him at work would take me majorly out of my way and mean I have to leave the house earlier than I already do. He typically starts work an hour later than me.

On the few occasions I have given him a lift I’ve been late to work despite allocating extra time as I’ve got majorly snarled up in traffic. Being late isn’t acceptable and stresses me out.

I have explained that it’s often impractical to offer lifts in the morning. After work I often go to the gym and again wouldn’t be able to that if I was picking him up.

I’m unsure if I’m being selfish by not offering daily lifts or if I should just tell him to drive himself!

And how do I talk about it with them?,"I've been dating my girlfriend at college for around a year now.  I am finishing up junior year, she is a year below so she's finishing up sophomore year.  Since I am going to be a senior I've been thinking a lot about things, one of them being my relationship.  I honestly don't think I want to be in a relationship with her after I graduate, while I'm working wherever I end up and she's still on campus.  I don't think it's as much about her as it is me wanting to be on my own for a bit after graduation to figure out what makes me happy, etc. since I have problems with being indecisive.  She's also my first girlfriend, and I'm pretty sure I want to date around a bit to get more experience and test the waters in that regard, but I don't think I need to tell her that part.  

We have not talked about this explicitly, but it seems as though she does very much see a future with me after graduation, based on a couple comments she's made about me ""coming back to visit"" for some events her senior year.  I feel like it's early because I don't graduate for another year, but I also feel like it is necessary to tell her this if I'm thinking it now since my mind likely isn't going to completely change in that time.  I just feel like communicating and being honest is the best for both of us in the long run.  

Yet I see so many couples that stick together through graduation, make long-distance work, etc. and I just feel bad.  I feel like there's this confusion/stigma about not seeing a long-term future, wanting to take some time to be alone an explore after graduating.  I can't really control that feeling and forcing a long-distance relationship just sounds like I'd end up miserable.

* same views, goals, lifestyle
* polite and the kind of guy you bring home
* families get along and each family likes the other
* both want children
* tidy, no drugs, no smoking
* sometimes helps out
* enjoys cuddling, etc
* same hobbies and like doing the same thigns
* same tastes in movies mostly and tv shows
* both like games

**Sex:** he doesn’t like sex \(only sometimes\- sometimes being like once every 1\-2 months\). I know the first question going to be asked is did we talk about it. Yes, I mentioned it before we got together to make sure we were on the same page. I like sex at least once a week if not more. Otherwise I start to get a bit rejected feeling.

He said that was fine, but he didn’t care about sex a lot, he cared about companionship and partnership. Coming from a past relationship where all that seemed to matter was sex, someone who cares about being a partner more than sex? That sounds great, and once a week seemed fine.

After the honeymoon period wore off, it’s been maybe once a month if not two. I have brought it up about once a month how I feel unattractive and while I really value that it’s not all about sex. It’d be nice to have more. He either will give two answers: he’s sorry he’s just felt unattractive lately and thats why \(perfectly reasonable\), or “sorry, I thought you cared about being partners than just about sex.” And, well then I feel bad, because he’s right that things shouldn’t be just about sex, a partnership is really important to me too, so I end up saying he’s right and drop it.

**Boundaries:** We have different boundaries. We have had issues where I felt he was flirting with others based off of actions or mannerisms that he's done. He has pet names for girls, but he says he gives nicknames to everyone. I mean he does give them to every girl, but he said it doesn't mean anything. I also get that in a way. I know people like to give others nicknames and petnames I suppose. I said nick names are fine, but why do they have to be pet names? He said they aren't, it's not a big deal, it's just fun. If anyone had a problem with it, they'd tell him. I said I don't know about that.

Another example is we discussed whether it'd be okay to say ""sup cutie"" to another girl. He said it was fine, they were just words, they weren't a big deal they didn't mean anything. I told him it made me uncomfortable, and they did mean something because that's literally what words were made for, to mean something. He said it wasn't a big deal because if he said it to another girl it's just words, but if he said it to me it was like ""aw look she's so adorable"". I told him I didn't get the difference, and wasn't he worried about leading anyone on?

He's always maintained that any flirting that happened was not actually him flirting, it was unintentionally done \(okay this can happen I get that\). If it's unintentional, why does it matter? I take the stance of you want to watch your behavior because you don't want to come across like you are flirting or want to lead anyone on. I said what if some girl thinks you are going to on a date because she asks you to dinner, you think it's as friends, you go and she kisses you. He said then he'd stop her and he'd ask why she even thought it was a date because they're just friends. I said she'll say that he was calling her pet names and flirting, so she might have thought something was going on.

Anyway, I'm trying to be more accepting. I consider flirting to be pet names \(not nicknames\), and anything I notice he did with me when we started\- if he mirrors the same tone of voice or mannerisms with other girls. I told him though that as long as it wasn't around me, I guess it was fine. As an aside, I've seen him talk to girls before and there are times when he acts normal \(friendly and joking but boundaries like all couples should\), and times when I don't see boundaries at all, so I know it's okay to be friendly/joking as long as it's obvious nothing is meant by it.

**Taking me seriously:** I feel like he doesn’t take me seriously. He says he does, but there are certain things that make me feel like he doesn't. We got in a minor car accident, and while we were fine, I felt like my back had been shaken up. Like, a jolt of shock had gone through it or something. I'd never been in one before, so I wanted to get it checked out just incase you know? so I went to do that, and my friend confirmed that sometimes you get back injuries during car accidents. He said was I sure I was hurt, because his didn't hurt. A few hours later, we had this conversation.

Him: I don't think you were really hurt. Me: what? Him: I don't think your back really hurt. I think you were just scared. \(this is all said in a friendly but slightly patronizing tone\) Me: Well..it did? Him: well mine didn't hurt. It wasn't that bad. Me: that's great, but we're two different people, and mine did. I just wanted to check even though it was nothing.

I just felt disrespected, I guess? Like sometimes I feel like he just lacks empathy or self awareness.

**Empathy:** Speaking of that, he does have a lot of empathy, but for certain things. There's certain people or things he is empathetic about, but I feel like for the most part he seems to be sort of...entitled, but he doesn't know it. Like, you know how teens are, where when we were teens, everything was sorta about our world scope, and so we were kind of self absorbed, even if we did care about other people and things. I find it frustrating that he doesn't proactively do chores, or do things that are best for a situation. For example, he had to go somewhere while his car was in the shop. He lives with a disabled uncle. His uncle relies on the bigger car because it's easier to get into from a wheelchair, can carry a walker, etc. There's also another family car, a smaller like economy sized car. He took the larger car, knowing full well it's the easier car to get into. Like, he knows, but he just doesn't think, like with the flirting thing. He doesn't think how his actions affect others if that makes sense.

**Chores:** He doesn't do chores unless i nag him\- is not proactive about chores. I'm not saying he's like the posts on here where the boyfriend's refuse to do chores or yell. He just doesn't think to do them. He'll do them if asked, but mostly is like ""well someone else will do them"" or ""later"". Example 1: Cooked dinner, left dishes in the sink. There is a dishwasher by the way. I said ""why don't we wash these or put them in the dishwasher?"" He said ""nah, if I leave them there, magically they'll be gone in the morning."" He meant that someone else would've cleaned it up by the morning. I said you can't just leave your mess for others, but it's not my house.

Example 2: I asked him to do laundry because there were no fresh clothes for work the next day. He had hours to do it, like it was 5pm and he didn't have to sleep until 10. I wasn't there. I asked him to just throw it in, and I'd do the rest, that way it was easier on him. He forgot, even though i reminded him. He was busy playing games. This happened enough times that now I do it to avoid this problem.

I talked to him about this too, multiple times. I say that he's a healthy able\-bodied young man that can do his own chores. He should not be getting other people to do his chores. He said he doesn't want to do them. I said I also don't want to do them, I still do them. I said he pays rent for free, he should be helping out around the house like I do. He said his parents like cleaning, it gives them something to do while retired. I said ""they always say anything you can do is appreciated though. You don't pay rent. You could at least do the harder chores so they don't have to"". For context, they are old and it's harder for them to do the heavy duty stuff like scrubbing the tub. I sat down and told him recently this really bothered me and I don't understand. He said he's just joking when he said all that stuff\- and he'll do chores if something has to be done.

I said that's fine, but why is it in the last 2 yrs, when I bring it up, you haven't done them unless much nagging has happened? It just seems like the type of thing you say when you don't want someone to leave, but I also think it's fair to give people time to change.To be fair, recently it's gotten slightly better, but only slightly. Like now he folds laundry sometimes instead of just washing the laundry and leaving me to fold. but it's like anything that takes work, he doesn't want to do.

**Openness:** Openness is a mixed bag here. Sometimes he's empathetic, and sometimes he's not. I opened up about some things that bothered me about me, I was crying because I feel a bit ashamed, and he was like ""well I don't really care about that so.."" and I know he meant like ""well it doesn't matter that this is the way it is, I still love you"", but still. I guess I was hoping for a more empathetic response like ""I'm really sorry I hope you're okay"". But sometimes, if I have a bad day, which occasionally I'll talk about, he'll say ""Oh, that sucks :\("" which is good, so I mean he can be empathetic, it just depends on when. One time I brought up something that bothered me and made me uncomfortable with him and a girl, and he said ""sorry I'm not sorry, It's was just a joke.""

He says I can't let stuff go, but how do you let go of stuff when you feel like you weren't heard or you didn't actually resolve anything? That's my issue though, and I understand that he may be frustrated by that. I just feel  like I can't tell him stuff because for the most part, he just doesn't empathize. I have a hard time with trust with being able to tell my partner anything, but not trust in general with him. Like day to day life yeah and I know I can trust him to be faithful and be my companion, but not sure about partner. This isn't all the examples, just some of them.

**Forgetting:** If I bring up something he said that bothers me or that he did, he always says he doesn't recall or he never said something when he did. Now, this may be true. He may truly not remember, because he said he doesn't think before he speaks he just says whatever, but it'd be nice to hear like ""well, that may be true I could've said that."" instead of ""well I never did that'. I feel like we have this conversation enough that I have to start recording what he says. I'll tell him he said one thing, and he'll say he said another, and I'm like well if you had said that, we wouldn't have fought over it because I would've felt heard, but I know you didn't say that because I remember exactly what you said.

**Children:** didn't know about children until 2 months ago when suddenly he decided he might want children \- not sure what prompted this.

Immaturity: trolls people on the internet. Keep trying to get him to stop, but he says it doesn't mean anything, that's just what you do. He doesn't actually mean it. I think there's a theme here with the not actually meaning it. For example, he uses hate speech during games, he's like one of those toxic players, except he's not red pill like or anything.

Anyway, that's all I can think of for now. We have a lot of good things. I will try to answer any questions. Reiterating he's not a bad guy, it’s just a bit like dating a teen. Like how teens aren't bad, they just only have their worldview and don't recognize how their actions can affect others. He's a nice guy who isn't a truly bad person, I think he's just still growing up I guess.

I know the common advice is the grass is green where you water it, not with another partner, but what if you keep trying to water it and you can’t tell if you’re growing it or drowning it? I’m trying to suss out if these are valid issues or there’s somewhere I need to bend. Thank you for reading!

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I have a few issues and I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable being upset because we have a lot of good things too.","['have', 'hard', 'time', 'decide', 'doubt', 'reasonable',

I like that girl no matter what, and I even never really talked with her.

My boyfriend and I started dating almost 2 years ago now. We broke up one time when we were 11 months in and that was for 2 months. In that time I texted one of my exes that lives in another state anyway so we never hung out or anything just talk. My boyfriend is from here so he went and hung with his friends and some girls and went on a date and kissed one of them. We got back together and he told me and I was sad but couldn't say anything because we were broke up anyway.
He is addicted to porn and at first I was down for it because I liked porn too and then me made it into something that I dreaded and something that almost makes me feel sick now looking at it. He would watch it when we fuck, when I suck his dick all that and I didn't mind at first until he started watching porn instead of wanting to fuck me. It made me really sad and crushed my confidence. Really... So when we got back together I said I don't want him to watch that kind of stuff anymore because he made it into something I didn't like, but he kept watching it and lying to me. Then I see he look up twerk challenge on YouTube and it make my heard drop because I'm only a small girl I don't have a big booty and allat but it makes me feel like I'm not even the type of girl that he's into. When I bring it up he just will get mad and act like I'm tripping but these are genuine thoughts and feelings going through me every day. I am so hurt that I want to break up but he is the kind of dude who knows what he's got and will fight to keep us together but he gets too comfortable and I think he just feels like I will never leave him because I have never done anything to make him think so. I think that's fucked up in itself how you could hurt someone who gives you their whole heart and loyalty and time.... I don't know... What would you all do?  Also from day 1 he always been crazy about me  ""checking out dudes"" so I don't but then I see him check out girls and he gets mad whenever I say it like wtf that doesn't sound fair...

So there’s this autistic kid is some of my classes and I feel like he is constantly harassing me because he has a crush on me. Most people say “aww that’s cute” when really it’s not! He comes up to me all the time saying “Hey, do you have a boyfriend” which I do and I always try to reply to him in the nicest way and try not to get rude or frustrated with him but he doesn’t seem to understand. One day as part as our English exam we had to do a play, he was in a different group but sitting right behind me while I was standing. Next thing I feel my ass getting slapped and squeezed and I froze and I didn’t know what to do. Most of my classmates just laughed at me. I didn’t tell a teacher because I felt so embarrassed. Another time a friend and I were walking across the quad at school, (bearing in mind EVERYONE will HAVE to walk across the quad between classes) next thing I hear is this loud shout coming from him, saying he “wants to do” me. 

Please help I don’t know what to tell him or how to let him down gently I guess.

Update: For the people saying “What if he’s not actually autistic?” He is! He has his own assistant teacher to keep him focused, he usually gets up and runs around the classroom if he’s bored and he doesn’t like loud noises. This isn’t the half of it 

I didn’t get a chance to talk to my teachers today as I was on the junior campus (I’m usually on the senior campus as I am a senior) I will speak up on Monday as I’m off tomorrow

Been at my current company for a few years, one of the best employment opportunities I've ever had. Awhile ago the boss of my department was replaced by a beautiful woman \(27\) Who just so happens to be married to the companies owner. When she first started, I certainly noticed a physical attraction. But as each day passed, i started noticing things about her that I appreciated. Weather it be qualities of her personality, the way said certain words, or her smile. There's this certain unsaid connection/understanding that we shared. our personalities are very alike so we usually have the same opinion on things.  We work in a fairly small office with one other person, so naturally this is something that just gets worst each day I spend with her. I'm starting to think of her allot more than I should.  I know any possibility of something more is ridiculous, as even bringing my feelings to her attention could potentially jeopardize my employment.\( not to mention I'm not the person to come between an already established relationship\)  But parts of me want her to know. So i guess its the classic case of wanting someone you cant have.  Don't know what I'm looking for as far as response. Just needed to get this off my chest.

He was waiting to bid on something on ebay, he’s been eyeing it for a while now but he ended up not getting it and losing the bid and I think he felt pretty disappointed.

So it made him feel down and he decided to make dinner with his new rice cooker he bought, but it turns out he can’t even use it because it’s the wrong plug and voltage so he had to go back and get it replaced with a different one, all while getting frustrated trying to find the receipt for it.

After he got the replacement, he ended up getting some fries but apparently they were too soggy and he didn’t enjoy eating them, sort of as a bad ending to a frustrating day for him.

I was with my friends today, it was someone’s birthday so I couldn’t be with him but was texting him to calm him down. I told him I’ll call him when I’m walking home so I did. He was venting and I could tell he was still frustrated. 

And during the phone call he said, “During times like this, I wish objects were sentient just so I can kick them and hurt them and hear them scream.”, which to be honest I found a little disturbing.

As a bit of background, I’ve been with him 4 months, he’s not very good with emotions, he does things sometimes that are socially weird, and he’s admitted he’s not good with reassuring or giving emotional support. He’s working on it and it’s fine but I have wondered sometimes if he might be a sociopath or something, and what he said today stuck out to me as something weird.

Help?,"So last Saturday (the 12th) was prom and this really awesome, hot, sweet guy asked me out a couple of days or so before the event. Anyways, we had a lot of fun and we really hit it off well. I stayed over at his place on Sunday and by chance, I saw his Reddit username. I decided to check it out yesterday and it was... well disturbing.

So for the most part his posts/comments are normal but he's said a lot of concerning things that makes me worried about our relationship.

He has not talked about our relationship at all. Kinda weird tbh :/. He spent an entire thread arguing whether or not it is ok to pressure/trick girls into sex. He admits to leading girls on, having sex, and then dumping them after he's bored. He says it's ""okay"" and ""harmless"". He admitted to cheating in the past. He says he regrets it but his other comments make me concerned. I fear that he sees me as a ""conquest"" rather than an actual person. We did have sex after prom and he did not dump me so I'm feeling a little confused about this whole thing. He admits to just using girls for sex and says he's never ""loved"" any of them but how come he's still with me? He hasn't dumped me yet. Maybe he's changed or has genuine feelings for me? Hopefully..

He also talks about how to avoid fake rape accusations and its in a pretty toxic subreddit so there's that.

I dont believe he's a bad person and I really like him but I cant help but feel like hes not a good person :(. He does make me feel special and hes popular, attractive, kind, everything I hoped for.

I also know his sister and she's a really cool girl and I know they have a good relationship. Idk how to feel :/

She just got out of a 4-year-long relationship in January, so she said she was not really ready for anything serious right now. She was crazy about me for about a month though; we went on several dates and were hanging out all the time like a couple would. 

However, she has stopped initiating these last 4 weeks. She used to text / snapchat me all day, every day. Every time I see her in person she seems very happy to see me, but I have not seen her near as much these last several weeks. She had to cancel plans with me recently but told me that she has really been missing me and wishes she could have seen me more these last several weeks had her life not been so crazy.

Despite her saying she's been missing me, though, she still has not really been reaching out to me even though it's the first week of summer break now. I messaged her today, and we exchanged a few snapchats, but she stopped responding before long.

I'm just confused I guess, but I don't really want to give up on her yet. She said we'd hang out at some point during the summer when she was in town. Just by knowing who she is, I know she would not say she was missing me if she did not mean it or if she completely lost interest. Should I just be patient, give her space, and message her every so often?

435,8jwgw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jwgw1/i_am_desperately_in_love_with_someone_i_cant_have/,I am desperately in love with someone I can't have feelings for and I don't know what to do.,"I have no idea where to begin so excuse me if anything I write is muddled, I just really need to pour my heart out. Bascially, I \(18f\) am utterly in love with one of my teachers \(46m\). I have tried to deny this for so long because it is wrong on so many levels, but I cannot keep ignoring it. Quick disclaimer: obviously I would never act on my feelings, both because it is innapropriate and because he has a lovely family \(I know his wife very well and I find her to be one of the sweetest human beings ever\). Also, while the use of the word love might seem extreme, and trust me I tried over and over to convince myself that it was a mere 'teacher crush' everybody experiences in highschool, I don't know what else it could be anymore. In fact, I have liked him for four long long years, which to me seems insane. I have quite literally been incapable of feeling anything for my peers because I keep making unhealthy comparisons between him and them.

And to add to how ridiculous this situation is, I think I fell in love with him *at first sight.* I am one of the most rational, un\-lovey dovey people there are and I don't ever believe in stuff like this, but I swear the moment I saw him I thought he was special. Sure, I was attracted to him, he is a good\-looking guy, but when I saw him I had this feeling I have never felt before that honestly feels as close to love as I know it to be. And I was right, because for four years I have done nothing but think about him. And the more I learnt about him, the more I discovered we are eerily similar \- we share the same passions, opinions and humour, and we get along in a way I have never experienced \(to this extent\) with anybody else. I cannot put into words how strongly I feel about him \- the closest approximation I can come up with is that my stomach and heart feel like they cannot fit inside my body when I am with him.

However, as of this month highschool will end and I will likely only see him one last time at graduation. I was really looking forward to this as I feel that not seeing him everyday will allow me to distance myself enough to stop myself from loving him. It sounds so stupid just writing this but I really don't know. And I can't confess it to any of my closest friends or family, especially since I know that if I was to ever say this to someone they would just tell me that it's a stupid teenage crush and that having not known love these are all just empty assumptions \- but, as immature as this might sound, I really don't think this is the case. I'm just so afraid I won't be able to let go of my feelings. Actually no, I am completely terrified, especially because I will never be able to get this off my chest and I don't know if the shame and regret will always be a weight I have to drag along for the rest of my life.

I have posted this on other subreddits, but I really do need advice.","['desperately', 'love', 'feeling', 'know', 'idea', 'begin', 'excuse', 'write', 'muddle', 'need', 'pour', 'heart', 'bascially', '18_f', 'utterly', 'love', 'teacher', '46_m', 'try', 'deny', 'long', 'wrong', 'level', 'ignore', 'quick', 'disclaimer', 'obviously', 'act', 'feeling', 'innapropriate', 'lovely', 'family', 'know', 'wife', 'find', 'sweet', 'human', 'being', 'use', 'word', 'love', 'extreme', 'trust', 'try', 'convince', 'mere', 'teacher', 'crush', 'everybody', 'experience', 'highschool', 'know', 'anymore', 'fact', 'like', 'long', 'long', 'year', 'insane', 'literally', 'incapable', 'feel', 'peer', 'make', 'unhealthy', 'comparison', 'add', 'ridiculous', 'situation', 'think', 'fall', 'love', 'sight', 'rational', 'un', '-lovey', 'dovey', 'people', 'believe', 'stuff', 'like', 'swear', 'moment', 'see', 'think', 'special', 'sure', 'attract', 'good', '-looking', 'guy', 'see', 'feeling', 'feel', 'honestly', 'feel', 'close', 'love', 'know', 'right', 'year', 'think', 'learn', 'discover', 'eerily', 'similar', 'share', 'passion', 'opinion', 'humour', 'way', 'experience', 'extent', 'anybody', 'word', 'strongly', 'feel', 'close', 'approximation', 'come', 'stomach', 'heart', 'feel', 'like', 'fit', 'inside', 'body', 'month', 'highschool', 'end', 'likely', 'time', 'graduation', 'look', 'forward', 'feel', 'see', 'everyday', 'allow', 'distance', 'stop', 'love', 'sound', 'stupid', 'write', 'know', 'confess', 'close', 'friend', 'family', 'especially', 'know', 'tell', 'stupid', 'teenage', 'crush', 'have', 'know', 'love', 'assumption', 'immature', 'sound', 'think', 'case', 'afraid', 'able', 'let', 'feeling', 'actually', 'completely', 'terrify', 'especially', 'able', 'chest', 'know', 'shame', 'regret', 'weight', 'drag', 'rest', 'life', 'post', 'subreddit', 'need', 'advice']"
436,8jwdjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jwdjw/bf_m25_kissed_another_girl_and_needs_a_break_to/,BF [M25] kissed another girl and needs a break to think things through.,"I’m going to try and keep this short. I, [F24] have been dating my BF for about 9 months now. I’ve been in abusive, awful, terrible relationships before. This is the best one I’ve ever been in and he’s been so incredibly amazing to me. We have a steady, solid relationship. 

Until last Thursday. It was sort of soon, but we were going to move into a house together that I was buying with my parents. I made it clear that it was an option to him if he’d like, no pressure, all on him, otherwise I’d live alone or get a roommate. No biggie. We fought last Thursday because the reality hit him and he realized he wasn’t ready to move in, and was questioning a lot of things since he just graduated college. He was scared of the future and if he got a job in another place. So we talk and figure that out, he needs time to think about everything. 

So I thought. The next day, I find texts on his phone asking a girl he works with if he should tell me “what happened the other night” saying we were breaking up and things had been going downhill for a while now. News to me, because he texted me that exact night saying breaking up was never even a thought. I confronted him and he said that this girl essentially confessed her love for him, he rejected her, and he wouldn’t risk our relationship over her. 

It never sat well with me, so I asked again, calmly. He admitted that he was pretty buzzed after working a 12 hour work day and beers with the coworkers. Apparently the girl decided that even though she knew he was dating me, she was leaving for a job hours away, and he was her boss, she would confess her love and make a move, and they kissed. It crushed me, moreso because he lied. He was extremely remorseful and broken up about it, and promised he was gonna talk to me about it after we got through a concert and trip this week, and discuss it when things calmed down. 

He reassures me that he still loves me, and it’s not that he’s unhappy, he was confused. He said that he was freaking out and confused over him graduating, finding another job, us leaving the honeymoon phase, and moving in, and that paired with the alcohol made a mistake. He said that he felt something there for a while and she was flirtatious but wrote it off and would never have risked our relationship and losing me over it. Until she confessed her love and they kissed briefly. He said he felt awful and guilty, and reassured me that if it were something where he was actually unhappy with me and wanted to be with her, he wouldn’t have wasted our time and left for her. 

After thinking it through and sorting my emotions, I believe him saying it was a one time mistake. I trust him, and I still love him, and want to work through things. He says he needs time to figure himself out and why he did what he did, if it’s something wrong him or the relationship, and make the right decision so he doesn’t hurt me in the future. We agreed on taking a break, with occasionally seeing each other and talking, trying to reevaluate and rebuild things. We both agreed we don’t want to see anyone else, and when I asked him not to give up on us over this, that I was willing to work through it, he said he isn’t giving up because if he did he would’ve been gone already. I know he’s hurting, and I know he’s sorry. I just can’t justify losing an amazing relationship over a drunken kiss. 

I hate having to wait over this break, when we already admitted that we missed each other over the last couple days. I’ve been a wreck; not eating, sleeping, can’t keep food down. I know what he’s doing is unfair, and he knows it too. He’s asking for a little time so he can think over things, make a decision, and try to rebuild things.

441,8jvw8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jvw8a/trapped_in_the_rubble/,Trapped in the rubble...,"I’ve been in a relationship for 8 years now. I came from a broken dysfunctional home and jumped right into a broken dysfunctional relationship with a narcissistic hypocritical verbally abusive and manipulative man child. I loved him. Once. But there’s just too much that has transpired to even put it all into words. 

Short version:  he separated me from what little family I had left, convinced me that all of my friends really weren’t, and brought me home like a wounded puppy. At first I couldn’t see what was going on. I was just so happy to actually be in a real relationship (I tried to date girls but it always ended horribly because I was trying to be someone I wasn’t). 

I moved to a bigger city because of my job and he dragged his feet the entire time. He wouldn’t get a real full time job. Had me footing the bills for everything even his drug problem. But hey, why would he care when he’s the one getting catered to and I was the one working 60 hours a week. 

We’re not a team. We’re not a couple. We haven’t had sex in almost a year. We fight all the damn time. But there was one fight I never got over... it was like something inside of me switched off and it was like he became a stranger to me. I didn’t care about taking care of someone who only took from me all the time and never stepped up to provide. 

I ended up meeting another guy when I least expected it and wasn’t even looking. He’s everything I’ve ever wanted. And tbh, since I’ve never gotten to date (I mean truly date) anyone, I was swept away by the attention and respect. I ended up falling in love with him. Hard. I tried to leave my partner but he pulled out every same old trick he’s ever done. Blocking me from leaving the apartment (false imprisonment), making a scene, crying, calling his mother and making it her problem (which he consistently does basically daily. It disgusts me so much. Every time we go at it he has his mother right there in his corner and they both twist their reality and try to impose it on me. It made me think I was crazy for quite a long time.. but that’s a different story).  

So one day I woke up and decided I couldn’t take it anymore. I left a note on the dresser, packed what was important to me and left. I got about two hours away before I broke down. All I could imagine was how crushed he was going to be. Granted he’s a horrible person, but he’s still a human being... the guilt pierced my consciouses and I turned around. That was the biggest regret of my life... 

Nothing has changed between us. I broke a great mans heart by being unable to find the strength to stick to what I knew was right for me... now he doesn’t talk to me and I literally can’t stop thinking about him. He’s in my dreams. Almost every song on the radio makes me think of him. Random stuff at my job makes me think of him. Someone walked by me at work the other night and they had the same cologne as him and it affected me so strongly I had to go hide in the back room to pull my shit together... 

I’m trapped beneath the rubble of all this shit and I’ve never been so low.. it’s like I’m walking  around in a depressed daze. Nothing matters to me anymore, not even my own well being. I’ve given up and checked out. And I don’t know what I’m supposed to do anymore....

The next morning rolled around and she sent me a screenshot of another text where her boss had asked her to come into work when we had planned the date, apologized, and asked if we could reschedule. I replied that I completely understood and that’s not a problem, and then asked if two days later would work better for her or if she had scheduling conflicts then I could work around her schedule. 

She never replied and it’s been two days and she still hasn’t replied. I’m assuming she ghosted, but why?

Should we have to say the words, “I am sorry”","My husband feels that when someone apologizes for something, that person has the right to say sorry in any manner he or she feels comfortable.

For myself, I understand that a sincere apology comes from the heart and agree with this in this aspect. Ultimately the best and most clear intention of making an apology is to begin with “I am sorry” and mean it. Then, explain the mistakes you made with no excuses and finally, how to avoid the mistake in the future or ask what can be done to make things better; however, he does not see it this way.

He feels like explicitly saying “I’m sorry” is not only unnecessary but cheapens the apology and renders it useless; therefore, he repeats the issue at hand and makes some references as to why we both made bad decisions toward the final argument happening.

Most of the time, I have no idea he is trying to say I’m sorry because he never actually says I am sorry, and it becomes a blowout argument. I’ve tried to tell him that I agree, we need apologies that are sincere, but perhaps the best way to avoid miscommunication is by starting out with a simple “I am sorry for X”.

He absolutely refuses to compromise and thinks it is unfair of me to expect him to apologize in a way he is uncomfortable with. I asked him, if the apology is meant to make amends with the other person, and the other person does not even know the person apologizing is saying sorry, what is the point of the apology?

I understand the need for fairness and total and complete honesty when it comes to stating what part you yourself played in the development of an argument; however, I feel like there are situations in which one person has made a mistake and has an obligation to say sorry if they want to rectify the problem, am I wrong?

I don't know where to start so I might as well start with this: my dad has never been one to show emotions, he's very stoic and he's never been very comforting of me when I get upset, especially towards his mom and sister. In fact, he's always chosen them over my mom and I, even after what all his mom's done to me over the years. 

His mom gave me herpes when I was a few days to a couple weeks old and I spent a good period of time in and out of the hospital. Obviously I still have herpes, and from the age I could tell people it hurts, my dad and his sister have been telling me if I wasn't such a little slut going and kissing other little boys I wouldn't have those sores. They're painful and shameful and when I get them all I do is cry, I don't even want to go outside because I know people stare at me weird. 

Then his mother doesn't speak to me for months on end(which my dad deems as my fault) but when she does all I hear about is how my racist and homophobic younger cousins are and how great they're doing and how wonderful they are. Personally as someone who, their only achievement has been not killing themselves and getting admitted in high school, yea it bums me out. I had a lot of dreams about serving in the military after high school but after being placed in a physc ward those dreams went down the shitter. His mom never knew I was in the hospital, she never calls and neither does his sister unless she's calling to snitch on me for something I posted on Facebook she doesn't like. And now that my grandma has been really sick he wants me to see her. I would like not to. His mother has neglected to want to know me for years and suddenly she wants to get to know me and see me. As a child she wanted to spend every moment with me and after my cousins were born she threw me out like a used up rag doll. It hurts and insults me that now she wants contact and time with me. She's told me that I was the only grandchild she's ever thought about hitting, now I wasn't the easiest child seeing as i had Adhd and was always either cranked out on new pills or seriously wound up. I couldn't help that, and to tell me this just really broke me. Now my dad, his mom and sister have always treated me like the black sheep and I've had it. My dad basically thinks that his mom and sister are always in the right wether his sister and her kids are calling me slurs or saying nasty things about my mom. And he thinks that I need to step up and be a better person even though he's admitted(but now says he never said it) that his family has been talking shit on me. He expects me to know if someone's in the hospital because the most recent time his mother landed herself in there, she was in there for days without him saying anything. He finally said something when I was on vacation with my mom and very much so loving other grandmother. He's always  guilting me about how awful i am to his family who doesn't want me around it seems. He wants me to visit her Saturday with him and it's not going to end well at all. I just need advice, my dad knows how I feel and says he doesn't care what I do or say about it, but I know he will and he and I will argue and he's going to hit me again. I'm conflicted and angry.

TL;DR  dad's family has me really messed up because I'm awful and they still expect me to make contact.","['have', 'issue', 'dad', '40_s', 'sister', '40_s', 'sick', 'mother', '60_s', 'hi', 'know', 'start', 'start', 'dad', 'emotion', 'stoic', 'comforting', 'upset', 'especially', 'mom', 'sister', 'fact', 'choose', 'mom', 'mom', 'year', 'mom', 'give', 'herpe', 'day', 'couple', 'week', 'old', 'spend', 'good', 'period', 'time', 'hospital', 'obviously', 'herpe', 'age', 'tell', 'people', 'hurt', 'dad', 'sister', 'tell', 'little', 'slut', 'go', 'kiss', 'little', 'boy', 'sore', 'painful', 'shameful', 'cry', 'want', 'outside', 'know', 'people', 'stare', 'weird', 'mother', 'speak', 'month', 'end', 'dad', 'deem', 'fault', 'hear', 'racist', 'homophobic', 'young', 'cousin', 'great', 'wonderful', 'personally', 'achievement', 'kill', 'get', 'admit', 'high', 'school', 'yea', 'bum', 'lot', 'dream', 'serve', 'military', 'high', 'school', 'place', 'physc', 'ward', 'dream', 'go', 'shitter', 'mom', 'know', 'hospital', 'call', 'sister', 'call', 'snitch', 'post', 'facebook', 'like', 'grandma', 'sick', 'want', 'like', 'mother', 'neglect', 'want', 'know', 'year', 'suddenly', 'want', 'know', 'child', 'want', 'spend', 'moment', 'cousin', 'bear', 'throw', 'like', 'rag', 'doll', 'hurt', 'insult', 'want', 'contact', 'time', 'tell', 'grandchild', 'think', 'hit', 'easy', 'child', 'seeing', 'adhd', 'crank', 'new', 'pill', 'seriously', 'wound', 'help', 'tell', 'break', 'dad', 'mom', 'sister', 'treat', 'like', 'black', 'sheep', 'dad', 'basically', 'think', 'mom', 'sister', 'right', 'wether', 'sister', 'kid', 'call', 'slur', 'say', 'nasty', 'thing', 'mom', 'think', 'need', 'step', 'well', 'person', 'admit', 'say', 'say', 'family', 'talk', 'shit', 'expect', 'know', 'someone', 'hospital', 'recent', 'time', 'mother', 'land', 'day', 'say', 'finally', 'say', 'vacation', 'mom', 'love', 'grandmother', 'guilte', 'awful', 'family', 'want', 'want', 'visit', 'saturday', 'go', 'end', 'need', 'advice', 'dad', 'know', 'feel', 'say', 'care', 'know', 'argue', 'go', 'hit', 'conflicted', 'angry', 'tl;dr', 'dad', 'family', 'mess', 'awful', 'expect', 'contact']"

Roughly two months ago my girlfriend and I decided to end our ~8 month relationship. It was VERY mutual and we parted on very good terms. (A combination of study and lack of free time led us to the conclusion that neither of us are really able to give what the the other the time that they deserve)

We still talk about 3 days a week over messaging and whatnot. We also work together so we see each other in person too.

Roughly a week ago she asked me if I could give her a lift home from work as we both finished at the same time. We grabbed some food on the way and just had a late “dinner” together in the car and had a casual catch up about how we were going and things. 

I’m housesitting for a neighbour for month (we get along well with the neighbours) and I offered if she’d want to stay one night during this time.

She asked when and I just said whenever you’d want to. She said she’d have to check because her schedule is fairly busy.

My question is: 

Is this a good idea?

I’m aware her saying “maybe” could simply mean no, but she also made a noticeable increase in contact/talking after I offered.

If anyone is able to offer some advice it’d appreciated a lot.

TL;DR
Mutually ended an 8 month relationship 2 months ago (we’re on pretty good terms). I have a free house and offered that she could stay over for a night. Is this a good/bad idea?

It's been like this ever since I had to leave college early due to illness. She barely ever talks to me because she thinks I'm too negative and gloomy. Granted, I'm not the most positive person in the world. But when you if you were like me and you had to deal with being diagnosed with cancer at 18 and having to tack on two extra years of undergrad because of pneumonia, you'd be pissed off too. We also had an argument while we were out driving. I'm currently 22 and don't have my driver's license but have been taking private lessons. I wasn't doing too well, not looking both ways at a stop sign and she got angry. During the argument, I told her I wanted to get my license to make her happy. She tells me she doesn't care if I get my license and she only told me to get it when I was 16 because ""that's what normal people do"". As if I haven't been dealing with being sick and going to college full time. Yes, I should have gotten it earlier, but the past is in the past. Does she expect me to find a time machine and go back and tell my 16 year old self to get his license?

I remember the day of my fifth grade graduation. My mom didn't show up. When I came home, she said she didn't show up because she was embarrassed of me because I got in trouble a lot during the fifth grade. Ever since then, all I've tried to do was make her proud of me. Whatever people thought of me didn't matter as long as I was doing good in her eyes. But as she's becoming more and more distant to me, it makes me feel like I don't matter to her anymore.

I never thought that she would ever let me down this hard. 

Her personality is the kind where there is always something going on that's ""fucked"", she's always late, she'll have mini freak outs over ordering pizza if it's not on her schedule or decides that she has made up something in her head that is very real to her about the trouble it takes to order a pizza but don't worry about her it's FINE!! No, no no\- whatever. It's like I always need to get an idea of how she's feeling so I can know not to take it personally if she's sulking about something. Or know not to mention that it would nice if she could pinpoint a day when she's coming into town without her getting upset that I'm putting too much pressure on her and being too demanding. I just simply learned to not worry about it and. if she wants to visit, she'll just float in whenever so I don't change my plans if I have any. She knows her way around my place. I have chosen to over look this as can understand that she's just edgy and wants to do her thing. Good 'ol best friend. That's just part of her personality. If I want a relationship with her, I have to accept that she is this way. The rewards for choosing this have absolutely out weighed the bullshit until now. 

ABout 2 or 3 years ago, I can't remember because honestly, I really wasn't paying attention she met back up \-after years and years with this guy.  She was planning on coming into town to visit me since he was living in a city about 2 hours away. At this particular time it wasn't just me who was excited and expecting her and as usual, she flaked around. I pointed out to her that WE \(Me and two others\) would like to know if we should go to the store and maybe have some dinner going for when she arrives or at the very least have some kind of a time frame so the two other friends could plan their time around her visit so everybody gets a chance to have a chill good time. She broke down crying and saying she didn't know and I didn't understand how much stress she was under and can't handle this kind of pressure and she's just not going to meet this guys at all then. I responded by saying I was sorry, it's just that it would be nice to know when to expect her because I think that would be a courtesy to all of us but then ended up admitting that I should be more sensitive and for her to just do her thing. I can't remember how it turned out because I really wasn't trying to deal with it. Let her do her thing and let it go.   Everything goes great for a long time. I meet the guy. He's great. He's one heck of a keeper, for sure. They're actually perfect for each other. They get engaged, but a house and some land. It's wonderful. Everything she wanted for so long and I was excited for her. Naturally, even though she'd only be 2 hours away, I was aware that she'd be needing to do important things to set up for a heck of a celebration and get settled in to her new life

She even wanted me to do her wedding gifts \(I'm a glass artist\) and was happy to do so. She sent me a small check last year, up front to cover kiln time and materials.Small detail and I;m not sure if it even matters but I had o spend it on my car but no matter, I can easily eat the rest\- this is SO EXCITING! Good for her!! 

Well, I got sick. I'm still sick. As of right now, I'm still sick and I'm at a point where it's just a kind of, let's see how much I can recover in three months, then we'll talk \(Doc\) because I have some serious damage to some vital organs. Other than that though, I feel pretty good. But when I say I was in a blur for months this past Winter, I'm not kidding. I swear at one point there was barely\-heck I don't know. It was astounding how sick I was. I remember at one point just wanting so bad to have another human being in the same room. I finally got to a point where I could stand up and do something that looked like walking and was cleared for not being dead so try to take it easy and focus on doing things good for my health, etc. She didn't bother to come down to see me. I talked to her when I felt clear headed enough to think and said that it kind of hurt my feelings that she didn't come see me. \(She had always said something to the effect of, ""Dude. Dude, you KNOW I will always be there for you when shit goes down. No matter WHAT. You HAVE to know that.""\) \-I didn't mention that I remembered those words all these years but I did say something. I got ""No, no, no. It's not like that."" I don;t understand because she's so busy and stressed and I'm being too sensitive. So I said she was probably right because my head probably isn't clear because I've been so sick. \-You know. I would have moved fucking mountains to go two hours up to see her and ask her I could do ANYTHING for her. But I let that go too.

Two years later. With complications of the same thing that I have been going through. I was heartbroken for her and I'm not going to lie, it scared me too. She was in a hurry and she was just making calls but she just wanted to tell me. So, assuming that she might drop everything to go to her friend's funeral, I called about every 3 days and left her one of our signature heart felt messages that we used to leave each other and said that I know she's busy and dealing with so much but please know that I'm here for her. ABout two weeks of this and I finally left her a message asking if she could please just at least text me that she's O.K. WELL. THE VERY NEXT DAY I just happen to see on the stupid FB that her fiance had posted pictures of them at a concert and making funny faces. That right there finally pissed me off. 

I messaged her\-since that was the only way I could try to reach her, that you know, I was worried sick and have been trying to be supportive and honestly, I think that's kind of bullshit that apparently I wasn't worth the time to even text me saying yeah, she's fine and that hon, this is not new behavior in my book and it's feeling a little more than simply one sided over here for me and that I value our friendship and understand she has a lot going on but Jesus. What's up with that? I told her that if it's really that hard for her to think about me at all then I don't know what to do. She responded by saying that all she knows to do is ""Fuck it"". \-But she better stop there because she might say something she'll regret and what's the problem? She ""Doesn't have bad feeling towards me.""  I told her she could have it then since it was so easy for her throw me away. We haven't talked since. 

Is it too much of a bitch move to just just finish this glass work for her and charge her shipping? Because it's going to be a lot and I'll be damned if she's going to treat me like that and then expect me at her wedding? Or any other thoughts? Because I think it's just pure insanity to try to fix this. I'm still dumbfounded. If she's going to throw me away like that, then she should be nothing more than a job on my table that I want out of here. That's what I think but obviously I'm posting because outside opinions of either validation or reality checks I haven't thought of are welcome. Plus it just felt nice to type all this out.

452,8jv9pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jv9pi/am_i_being_too_sensitive/,Am I being too sensitive?,"My boyfriend (28) and I (28) have been dating for a year. He never loses his temper with me and has a calm even vibe about him generally. I do have some concerns: when he drives he gets frustrated and tends to yell at people which makes riding with him uncomfortable . (Some mild road rage, he never does anything stupid like yell directly at people or speed or endanger us....just lots of yelling and complaining). 

When I drive he often critiques my driving and is critical of me “why did you park there” “why don’t you speed up?” in an annoyed tone because he would have done it differently . He never yells at me but he likes to direct me, etc. It was really getting on my nerves so I told him last weekend to please not comment on my driving unless I’m going to hit someone or do something illegal. Is this fair? 

He just seems to have a critical nature about him which is hard for me to shake sometimes. Some examples: we recently went to a concert together and he seemed to have a good time but at the end we left a little early to avoid traffic and he explained “my favorite part of the concert was when we left early to avoid traffic, best part of the night!” And I was like “was that really your favorite part?” He was so happy about leaving early and made no comments about the band or anything .This made me feel bad because it’s like he didn’t have fun when he says things like this. He acted like he was having fun during the event but then comments like this make me feel bad.  It kind of put a damper on the evening. He didn’t make an effort to comment on anything else about the concert. 

Another example: we went out to dinner with friends last night to a Greek place in town. He isn’t a huge fan of Greek but I’ve been to this place and it is amazing so I wanted him to give it a try with us. As he was pulling into the restaurant he sees a sign next door that says “for sale” and he is like “oh looks like it’s closed, looks like we can’t go after all”. (it wasn’t closed) This made me start to feel bad like he has already decided he isn’t going to enjoy himself. During dinner he made a few comments after we ordered about how he “wasn’t going to like it anyway”.  He ended up saying it was okay but his negative comments as we were pulling into the restaurant annoyed me. 

When we went out for pizza recently he ordered a margarita pizza and it specified Roma tomatoes on the description of he pizza. He was so excited as it’s his favorite  and when he got his pizza it wasn’t Roma tomatoes and the whole rest of the evening he complained about how it was the wrong tomatoes and they ruined his pizza and how bad it was. The rest of the date he just wouldn’t let it go. It makes the mood of the evening negative for me...am I being crazy to feel this way? 


Should these comments not get to me? When I bring it up he tells me he is “just joking” or I’m being too sensitive but when he makes comments like this it makes the experience of going out not as fun for me. I love my partner and want him to enjoy himself.  I know every experience isn’t going to be great but His tendency to focus and comment only negative things is causing me to feel bleh. I *can* be a sensitive person so I know I’m part of the issue. Have you dealt with this?

Me [21/F] and my partner [23/M] have been together for more than half a year now. We've had our fair share of problems, which I'll go into in a moment, but lately things had been going really well for us.

A few months back we split for a short time, due to him being really withdrawn, not wanting to spend time with me etc, general lack of trust on my part. But we did end up getting back together. Prior to that, at the beginning of the year, we very nearly split after I found he'd potentially planned to cheat on me with a friend of his who apparently liked him, and he planned to leave me ""in a week"". I'm not sure we ever really addressed the issue, but we stayed together anyway.

During both of those times, he was really distant, didnt seem like he enjoyed being around me, ignored me for hours and made excuses not to talk to me, and right now he's doing the same things again. 

We say 'I love you' all the time and talk about the future and stuff but I really dont know where I stand.

I feel like my SO's partner/lover, but I don't feel like his friend/best friend. Is this normal and how do I cope with this jealousy?","I've never felt this way in a relationship before. I've never been jealous of anyone that comes into the relationship. But with my current relationship, I'm jealous of the way my bf behaves around his friends cause he acts differently. Let me first say that he treats me well as his gf. He will try his best to console me, he pays for dinners, he tells me how much he loves me and how happy he is with me, etc.  Here is the issue that I have. When we are together, most of the time our conversations are lackluster, emotionless (except when anger is involved), somber, mellow. But when we are together with friends, he is so energetic and so talkative. He truly seems happy. I don't understand why I can't see that side of him when we are together. Very rarely will I see him act this way when it's just the two of us.   When I spoke to him about this, he says it's a good thing that I make him feel calm. 
 
But I'm still very hurt and jealous when we are out with friends, and I've brushed it aside for many years(we been together for about 4 years). Recently I been feeling more hurt since he has been hanging out with my best friend. When my bf and bestie are alone together, he tells me about how much fun they have. And the other night they went to a concert together. I couldn't attend due to other commitments, but he posted multiple selfies of himself with her to his Snapchat story. He didn't send the selfies to me. But sent all of his other snaps to me. He nnnneeeverr uses Snapchat. If he does, it's rare, and he will never take a selfie. But here are multiple selfies with her on his story. My best friend 100% doesn't have feelings for him. And I was always confident that he felt the same way. 
I've gone to concerts with him before. He is still his mellow self, and the are Metal bands! I'm so confused by all of this. I want to make him happy like that too!! Are we just not compatible? Should I talk to my bestie about this? 


Tldr; my bf acts energetic with his friends, either alone or with a group of friends, but when we are alone together, he is mostly calm.

I’m almost 48, and my wife is almost 40. A year ago last September, I found out that my wife had sex with a guy that she works with. At first, I believed it was just an emotional affair. However, I keep discovering new levels of infidelity \(sex with the OM, escorting before we were married, etc.\), just as I’m getting acclimated to the previous transgressions.

In September of last year, I found an email and some texts on her phone that alerted me that something was up. I confronted her a few weeks later. She said that they had talked a lot about their problems \- his bad marriage, her stress, etc. She said that he tried to hold her hand in the office once and that he tried to kiss her on one of their walks, but that was it. She said they never had sex.

I believed her, but told her that they had to stop all communications outside of work. No emails, phone calls, or texts unless they were work related. I told her that if she continued I would leave her. I wouldn't want to, but I would consider that choosing him over me and I would never be able to trust her again. She agreed.

Over the next few weeks, I saw that they were still communicating \- texts, occasional phone calls, and emails. Most of the content was non\-sexual. It was mostly them talking about their day, but she was definitely hiding by it from me. Once, for example, they talked on skype during lunch. She cut it short when I logged back on to my computer, because she knew that I could see that she was on a call with someone and would ask questions. Later that day, she called him while I was driving home from work. She blew him kisses before she hung up \(as well as on one other call\). I asked her several times point blank if they had been communicating. She looked me straight in the eye and denied everything without even flinching.

I busted confronted her again, based on phone records of calls and texts that were clearly outside of work hours. She tried to tell me that he just texted her to see if she was ok. I shut her up when I told her there were 16 texts, plus phone calls of an hour. She said that she thought I only meant they could not flirting or talk about anything personal, but other \(friend\) stuff was ok. I told her that was bullshit, otherwise she wouldn't have tried to hide it from me. We talked. She cried and agreed to cut off all nonessential communication, so I agreed to stay.

She did tell the OM that they had to stop. She was afraid I would divorce her. He agreed. However, shortly thereafter, they were still some communication, just not as much as before. I was reluctant to tell her that I knew, because I didn't have a smoking gun, and I would have to reveal how I knew. At that point, I was afraid she would cover her tracks more carefully.

A few more months went by as I was struggling with whether or not it was right to leave someone for ""just"" an emotional affair. Eventually, I realized I could recover some old texts from a phone that she no longer used. I found some incriminating texts. I ran them by one of my friends for a sanity check. He said it definitely sounded like they had sex.

Immediately, I took the rest of the day off, drove home, took out 1/2 of our savings, and packed/moved ALL of my stuff out of the house. She was shocked, and she admitted that they had sex when I went back to The States for a few weeks. This happened just before our two year anniversary, and four months before my first discovery.

She kept me on the phone late that night, and she convinced me to talk to her in person the next day. I was afraid that if I went, she would talk me into staying. That's exactly what happened.

I also told her about some emails I found from before we were married. In two or three emails, she negotiated terms for a massage a BJ \- $120. She said that at that time, she was thinking ahead to her move to Canada. \(We moved to Canada to help take care of her sick parents.\) She didn't know if I was going to marry her, and she was worried about money. She started thinking about women who do that sort of thing and wondering what it would be like. In the end, she said, she couldn't do it and she didn't go through with any of them. I didn't believe her, but I didn't have a smoking gun.

Things have been pretty quiet since then \(four months\). She’s cut off all non\-essential contact with the OM. However, it’s not the current OM that I fear, it’s the potential of another OM in the future.

Four weeks ago, I found a treasure trove of emails from two older email accounts. There were a LOT of emails that made me want to vomit.

I discovered that she was answering ads on Craigslist and Backpage.com for sensual massages, which included HJ, BJ, and even intercourse \(at least 3 times\). She was careful with most guys \(asked for “no fluid exchange”\), but I know she had unprotected sex with at least one guy, because she was afraid he got her pregnant. She did this over a 5\-month span, which ended about 7 weeks before we got married.

The 4 months before she started escorting, she was on dating sites like MillionaireMatch and WealthyMen.com. We went through some rough patches, but a lot of this happened outside of those patches. She even met a few of them for dinner.

Before we met, she dated a guy for 7 years. Five years into it, she cheated on him. She had sex with one guy at least twice. He moved away, but they kept in touch for a few years. They tried to meet up, but could never work out their schedules.

When she was in her teens, she dated a guy who others thought wasn't good enough for her. Another guy convinced her that the other guy wasn't good enough for her, so she left him for the other guy. A bit later, a new guy convinced her to leave that guy for him.

My wife seems to have an unhealthy need for attention and validation. Before we met, she carried out a very explicit email conversation with a guy she never met in real life. He really stroked her ego with sexually explicit comments. She sent him nudes and explicit videos. This ended around the time we met. This was before she started escorting, so I think this made the transition easier. It also showed me that she was way more sexual than I had realized.

She has two long\-term friends. I don’t think she’s had sex with them, but I could be wrong. She sent both guys nudes, including explicit vagina pics. She sent both of them a video of her masturbating. One was just two months before our wedding. She sent one of the guys a video of her playing with her tits six weeks after our wedding.

Another complication is that my wife wants to have a baby REAL bad! I’ve been able to dodge the bullet for almost a year, but time is running out. She wants to start trying again in the next few weeks. I’m generally unhappy with our marriage, but I feel bad about throwing in the towel. I feel guilty about her never being able to have a child if I leave. \(She's almost 40.\)

As I said, my wife has been “good” for the past 4\-6 months or so. I know she has broken things off completely with the OM. She's also cried and apologized several times for what she did. However, the problem isn’t the OM, himself, but rather her own propensity for cheating and her high need for validation and attention. I believe that my wife really wants to have a normal relationship, and she’s terrified of being abandoned.

My wife said that, just like Mary Magdalene, everyone deserves redemption and another chance. Do you think someone like her can change? Can she reform and be faithful for the rest of our marriage? Could it be that she was riddled with insecurities and uncertainties about us being together, but now she’s realized how much she really loves me, or am I fooling myself? Is she just a ticking time bomb waiting to go off? What are the odds that she will cheat on me again?

I really do love my wife, but I’ve been dealing with this every day for over a year now, and I’m mentally and emotionally drained.

TLDR: Wife used to be an escort now wants a baby. Have no idea if she can change.","['m48', 'find', 'wife', 'f40', 'escort', 'cheat', 'marriage', 'marry', 'year', '48', 'wife', '40', 'year', 'ago', 'september', 'find', 'wife', 'sex', 'guy', 'work',

I had that funny feeling, like he was hiding something. He left his phone unlocked when he went upstairs and I quickly scrolled through his texts. Found recent ones from a girl I had never heard of and he had never mentioned. They seemed familiar and casual: things like ""hey there how's it going :) ?"" and ""work sucks today!"" and such. Nothing explicit but still seemed flirty. I only looked for a few seconds and then put the phone down, obviously feeling very guilty and equally shaken.

My super internet stalking skills led me to discover that they attended the same college, and he was a TA in the same major that she was an undergrad. The timelines overlap. I can only assume that he was her TA or at least knew her from the department. But he's never mentioned her name, and they don't seem to share mutual friends on social media. Plus he graduated 6 years ago...

Am I being too paranoid? Should I talk to him about this? Admit what I did? Forget about it? I do trust him for the most part, but I also know that he was dating a married woman before he met me, and that he was friends with the guy...so he has the capacity to lie. We've been together for ~9mo and are considering moving in together in the fall.

I really don’t like this place it’s full of drunk people, drugs and stuff like this. I told her I’m not comfortable with the idea of being in such place and I told her I actually really don’t want her to go there (she still has a choice ofc). I also asked if it would be possible to go somewhere else (sunny beach has a certain name). But her friends really insist of going there because great night life cheap alcohol and this. I have no problem with her traveling with friends even when it’s giving us less time (we’re in a ldr) but it’s just the thought of her being drunk around other drunk&horny guys with her drunk(and some of them single and equally horny) friends will make me terribly restless uncomfortable and worried. So my question to you Redditers is: am I being to controlling or do I have the right to strongly express my opinion of her joining her friends?

Note: we’re in a healthy relationship if you ask me we love each other a lot and I trust that she won’t do anything wrong (like cheating or overly flirty behaviour) but she sometimes has a tendency to drink too much (not being able to walk, throw up and stuff) bc peer pressure.

She was my first love and claims I was hers. When we broke up she ended it with me when she left for college because she said it was too hard to continue and shed miss me too much. As I later found out after two months she was dating someone new I got really mad and told her I cheated on her \(which i regret and did\). I really loved her and Im not in love with her anymore but, I do still miss her. We have been broken up for almost two years now and she hates me. Ive seen her twice since the breakup. On one occasion we sat down and she cried telling me how i hurt her and i crappy i am and then another occasion was the most recent where she saw me at her college with this girl i was dating at the time.

So basically about a month ago I started hanging out a lot with a brilliant, funny, every adjective under the sun kind of woman \(girl? I feel like I'm getting too old to say girl, but I don't know\). We met one night and since then we have spent 5\+ hours every day gaming together, always at the same time. I know I definitely have a crush on her but I have no idea how she feels about me. Of course the most obvious way to find out is to simply ask, but I also know that that puts pressure on any relationship, especially if she doesn't feel the same way, so I was hoping from among the noise you guys could help me figure out at least a hint of whether this is onesided or not.

So first things first. Obviously we hang out every single day for extended periods of time. After about two weeks she had added me on Steam, Facebook, given me her phone number, and now we also whatsapp on and off. Usually about cats and dogs which we both enjoy, but it typically is me writing to her first, except in the evenings when she'll use it to ask me if I'm ready to play. She sometimes sends a little heart in chat ♥ like that, but when it comes to me she'll say something like ""well if you want to know what I think of you"" and then she'll send like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ along with a :\* which apparently is a kissey smiley? She also always makes a point of stating how much fun she's had, and we laugh a lot together \(except when one of our depressions plays up, but that's a whole other story.\) One thing that particularly stuck with me is that she likened herself and me playing together to a friend of hers and her boyfriend, saying something like ""well we've both got our crazy partners, eh?"", paraphrased obviously.

Those are the ""positives"". However, we also never really talk about anything personal beyond the game if it isn't about the cats or dogs. Furthermore she lives a couple hours away at least \(big deal for me here in Europe\), and she has mentioned being signed up on dating apps. In the second week we hung out she said she had just come off of a great date as well, and was super happy, but since then I haven't heard anything about dates, yet have no reason to suspect that that has come to an end. Finally, she has complained several times about guys just adding her on Facebook or elsewhere to flirt or inquire about her relationship status, stating vehemently ""I hate men"" with some sarcasm but clearly not completely, which is part of the reason why I haven't asked her directly.

Anyway, let me have it, I know nothing coming out of here is a definitive answer but I really could use some outside perspective.","['25_m', 'meet', 'lovely', 'woman', '26_f', 'online', 'game', 'idea', 'relationship', 'right', 'fair', 'warning', 'overanalyze', 'shit', 'sort', 'thing', 'harsh', 'basically', 'month', 'ago', 'start', 'hang', 'lot', 'brilliant', 'funny', 'adjective', 'sun', 'kind', 'woman', 'girl', 'feel', 'like', 'get', 'old', 'girl', 'know', 'meet', 'night', 'spend', '5', 'hour', 'day', 'game', 'time', 'know', 'definitely', 'crush', 'idea', 'feel', 'course', 'obvious', 'way', 'find', 'simply', 'ask', 'know', 'put', 'pressure', 'relationship', 'especially', 'feel', 'way', 'hope', 'noise', 'guy', 'help', 'figure', 'hint', 'oneside', 'thing', 'obviously', 'hang', 'single', 'day', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'week', 'add', 'steam', 'facebook', 'give', 'phone', 'number', 'whatsapp', 'usually', 'cat', 'dog', 'enjoy', 'typically', 'write', 'evening', 'use', 'ask', 'ready', 'play', 'send', 'little', 'heart', 'chat', '♥', 'like', 'come', 'like', 'want', 'know', 'think', 'send', 'like', '♥', '♥', '♥', '♥', '♥', '♥', '♥', 'apparently', 'kissey', 'smiley', 'make', 'point', 'state', 'fun', 'laugh', 'lot', 'depression', 'play', 'story', 'thing', 'particularly', 'stick', 'liken', 'play', 'friend', 'boyfriend', 'say', 'like', 'get', 'crazy', 'partner', 'eh', 'paraphrase', 'obviously', 'positive', 'talk', 'personal', 'game', 'cat', 'dog', 'furthermore', 'live', 'couple', 'hour', 'away', 'big', 'deal', 'europe', 'mention', 'sign', 'date', 'app', 'second', 'week', 'hang', 'say', 'come', 'great', 'date', 'super', 'happy', 'hear', 'date', 'reason', 'suspect', 'come', 'end', 'finally', 'complain', 'time', 'guy', 'add', 'facebook', 'flirt', 'inquire', 'relationship', 'status', 'state', 'vehemently', 'hate', 'man', 'sarcasm', 'clearly', 'completely', 'reason', 'ask', 'directly', 'let', 'know', 'come', 'definitive', 'answer', 'use', 'outside', 'perspective']"

I feel like when we're together, one of us is always on the phone or doing something so we don't have any kind of quality time together. It almost feels deliberate, like subconscious.

 She doesn't have any type of sex drive, although she did when we first got together. Now we have sex it just feels like it's solely to get me off and it completely takes any passion or feeling out of it. I've stopped even asking for sex because I just feel like it's all one-sided. 

We both suffer from depression and anxiety and I think that the stresses of Life has caused us to grow apart. Sometimes I feel like I want attention from others because I don't get it from her. I am half of the problem and I understand that. I have been trying to talk about it and be close with her, but sometimes I'm afraid too much damage has been done. 

I'm writing this in a depressed state so my perception may be askew, but this is constantly eating at me. I feel like it's been so long since I've had any kind of quality time with her, it's like I have a roommate. 

This is the prime of our lives so we should be living it up, be enjoying ourselves and having lots of sex and new experiences with each other. She's just not that type of person, but I am and I need her to get on that level so we can be alive again. Maybe I'm being selfish, I'm aware that it takes two to tango. This has been going on for a while and this morning it's really eating at me. I find myself looking at other women in my office although I wouldn't cheat on her. I just feel like if things don't change I'm going to make a decision at some point that I may regret. 

I'm not necessarily expecting answers I just wanted to talk to somebody outside of my bubble.

After meeting the first time, there was no sex but there was a bit of groping from his side, which I said I liked, and then I gave oral (But not until he ejaculated)

I felt really guilty and wanted to go back to ""redo"" it. That time and the next two times he respected my wishes not to be touched so we just sort of hugged and such.

Recently all that happened was I got slapped on the ass once. I didn't say stop even though he told me to say so if I was uncomfortable.

I don't really want to say I was raped as I don't feel as though I was forced into anything. 16 Is the legal age where I am so it wasn't stat. rape either.

Obviously I feel stupid and ashamed, and would like to lose contact and pretend it never happened.

The issue is that he knows where I live. I know he wouldn't harass me or anything like that, or dare to stalk/do anything. What would be the best way to make him not want to talk to me or?

I was considering telling him that he ought to stop talking as parents started to check through my phone and it may get him caught?

I also thought of saying that my parents know and they said it's either I stop talking or they get police involved.

I want to not feel ashamed, but I'm worried I ruined my life somehow?

I also am worried that I'll do worse in exams without him help and he regularly does help me, and am worried that I'll somehow do worse without his support.

I am 30 and she is 31 and she never has energy for anything and has been complaining for the last couple of months that she is always tired.

I work full time, 45+ hours a week, and she works 50% and is going to school 50% so she has a full load as well. I generally am gone more than she is, but given the fact that she has to study a couple of hours on weekends, I would say that we are pretty much equal on that front.

I do everything I can to make her life easier from cooking to cleaning to giving our son a bath to walking the dog everyday. Of all those things, she might do one of those a day and normally I try to do the larger tasks to loosen the load on her.

She generally sleeps 9 - 10 hours per night and I usually go to the gym when her and my son go to sleep so I get roughly 6 hours per night. Our relationship is ok, not as intimate as it used to be, but that is normal with a small child and we don’t really fight that often.

I am not mad at her or anything like that, but seeing her like this frustrating because I don’t know what is causing her to be this way and I don’t know what more I could be doing. Does anyone have any ideas?

Later on that year, I moved into the same neighbourhood as him (*We are like 2 buildings away from each other).

One day, when I was going to get grocery, I saw him with another guy walking down the street. I went to say hi, but he acted extremely strange in front of me (He approached me and blocked me from seeing what the other guy looks like). Couple days later we hung out again, and I asked him if he is seeing someone when I was driving him home from dinner, and he said yes. They met while I was away. My heart was truly broken, because I thought we could've get back together. Before he left my car, I told him I can't do this anymore and we should stop seeing each other. But he told me he still thinks about our relationship and he doesn't even like this current guy that he is seeing. He is dating him because he is the only guy that wants to date him in our neighbourhood. 

For the last couple weeks, it was a total nightmare. Because they live 2 buildings away from me. So I can see them on the street from my apartment. I see them when I was doing grocery shopping. I see them at restaurants. I see them EVERYWHERE! I don't know how to heal my heart when I see them together all the time.

I am 25 years old have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over 5 years now and have been going through some rough emotions.

A few months ago I started working as a sales associate for a cell phone company that has been pretty good for the most part and it's the first job I've gotten that I have devolped positive relationships with my coworkers. 

Ever since then I noticed my girlfriend becoming more moody and aggressive with her tone. We went to the clinic to see if she was pregnant but it turns out she's not. 

Once she came to work with her friend and I noticed she got really tense when she saw my coworkers. One in particular since she is attractive but I didn't think anything of it at the time. The only thing that popped into my head is if I made her mad? She leaves and the following day we talked about what was going on and she started crying. So after that I figured everything was fine until we stopped at my friends house and almost started to argue in front of my best friend. He says something that calms that situation but she still gets mad at me for small things.

At this point I don't know what to do. Everyday that goes by I feel more exhausted. And I think about breaking up with her but I become scared of the thought of completly losing her.

Any advice is welcomed.

476,8jt6ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jt6ue/boyfriend_24m_still_thinks_ex_crush_20f_is/,Boyfriend (24M) still thinks ex crush (20F) is prettier than current girlfriend (25F),"Hello! 
(25F) I’ve came across something that ruined my night and turned out to make me very sad and disappointed with my boyfriend (24M).

We have been dating on and off since 2013. By that time, I (25F) had just gotten off a very dramatic relationship with someone I loved but was constantly fighting over jealousness. 

I started having a crush on a boy (24M) who was my friend and who I knew that liked another common friend (20F). He never tried to approach her neither tell her that he liked her. As my feelings towards him were growing, I decided to declare to him and tell him I didn’t want to be friends to him anymore, as I knew he liked somebody else. I didn’t want to be in the friendzone, so I told him I wanted to stay away from him. Surprisingly, he told me he also liked me and we could try to figure out a relationship. We agreed to try, as we were supposedly in the “same situation” (of liking each other but also liking the persons we liked before) but ended up breaking up around 2 or 3 months later because he couldn’t stop liking our other friend (20F) and I couldn’t take that situation.

I was very upset by that time, but we were mature and honest to each other, so I thought we could still be friends and I even wished he could date the girl he liked in the first place.

I went one year abroad and we could be distant friends nicely. He also went abroad to study and we eventually met. He wanted to get back with me, but I was still hurt from what happened in 2013.

I came back to our country first, and tried to move on with my life, not accepting dating with him again.

Around 2014 he moved back to our country and asked the girl (20F) he liked in the first place for a date, which she said she’d be too busy to go. (Didn’t say “no”, but also didn’t accepted). 

In 2015 we met and talked about everything that had happened to us in the last years. We agreed we still liked each other despite everything that happened and decided to start dating again. By this time I was very jealous of the other girl he liked, and as we are all friends that had activities together in the same group, we used to hang along together quite often.

He had been reassuring me since then that he had overcame his feelings for her, and that he doesn’t like her anymore. I am still kind of jealous as even though we don’t meet her very often anymore, my boyfriend always thinks our single friends who also knows her like her, and I find this disturbing as it seems like he’s jealous of her dating other guys or just think she’s too wonderful and all the boys will like her.

The things got really annoying for me today, when we were talking about this and he accidentally told that a male friend of us who had a crush on her (20F) before must be desperate, as he started dating another girl (26F) who’s much less prettier than her (in his opinion). I started pressuring him and he slipped out that he also thinks that she’s prettier than me. I immediately got very sad and mad, as we have been dating for almost 3 years now, and they barely see each other. I got so disappointed. He told me it was not a big deal, (because looks weren’t what mattered the most to him) but I feel very unappreciated for him still thinking she’s prettier than me, even after all this time we’ve been together. 

In my opinion, beauty is not the most important thing, but it is important, as it’s linked with attraction and wanting to be with somebody. 

To make things worse, me and her are ethnically similar, as we are both small Asian girls.

I wanted advise on how you would feel in my skin. Am I being paranoid, or do you think he really settled for “less” just staying with me, as she didn’t want to stay with him?

However, with financial issues, I had to move and we are long distance again. Since we talked about it for months, agreed it would be best to do so, I figured it would be okay, especially since it's only **one month**.

**In under a month** \(we've been talking everyday\), she tells me she's had lunch with a co\-worker and killed some time at the mall with another one \(both male\). She talked about both of them as friends and I thought nothing of it.

The next night, she calls me, and she says ""we need to talk"". She says she thinks she might want to stay and not move to where I am and doesn't know what to do. She says because she likes living there. So I start asking questions. The more I ask, the more I uncover.

She likes one of them. She has thought about sleeping with them. She has thought about what it would be like to be with them. She has not thought about me or our relationship much at all \(her words\). She says we don't communicate well together but when I ask what we can do better she says I don't know. It seemed to me that is her way of saying we don't communicate well and I don't want/care to work on it. She said he's flirtatious and she enjoyed being pursued. 

I really care about  her and I viewed my decisions with the idea that we are in this together. I am stunned and truly hurt that in less than a month she acts as if I was never there. She says she wants to work it out but feels conflicted by her feelings. While I agree that we have some challenges, I think we can work on them but it seems she would rather not. I'm in my thirties and this is the only relationship I've ever been in. I always believed that I should wait for the ""right person"". I am sad because I still feel they are the right person but they don't seem to feel that way anymore. How naive I was. If this doesn't work out I am going to have a real hard time not being depressed.

I've recently started getting feelings for her (2 weeks ish) and wanted more. So last Friday we went to fabric (dnb club in London) with her and her female friend and took MDMA and had an awesome night. The intention was to ask her for more than a friendship. 

We got out at 7 am, grabbed a coffee and then chilled in a park for a bit. Eventually, her friend went home and we decided to stay and then spent the day at London zoo. Had a really good day and then we went to hers in the evening on the premise of watching Eurovision. After that was over we were lying in her bed and I decided to make my move and ask her if she wanted more than friendship. She said yes and then we spooned, kissed etc. No sex or foreplay or like that. But lots of intimate contact. 

We then spent most of Sunday together as well and I finally left to go home in the evening after spending basically the whole day in bed together cuddling. 

We don't see each other much at work other than every Tuesday and this Tuesday we went out to see a film. For some reason on the date she seemed a little off, and wasn't giving me any real positive signs. Had a good time but something felt off for some reason. I asked if she wanted to go to Alton towers on Saturday and she agreed which is a good sign, so I'm a bit confused. 

Admittedly I wasn't on best form which I'm putting down to tiredness and suicide Tuesday from the MDMA, so I'm hoping that is the same for her. But I don't want to come across as needy and ask how she felt etc.

I feel like I should leave it until the Saturday and have a good day with her then, and see how it goes. The other consideration I'm having is ask her if she wants to go down to a hotel on the Friday so we don't have to get up early on the Saturday(is about a 4 hour drive). I'm not really sure how to proceed because I've been out of the game for a while. But I really want to make a good shot of this because we have loads in common and get on well. I have to say as well, I have always been terrible at reading the signs and it has always been my downfall so I wonder whether I'm reading too much into it all.","['girl', 'like', 'cold', 'detach', 'date', 'm/26', 'close', 'girl', 'f/21', 'work', 'chat', 'load', '3', '4', 'month', 'recently', 'start', 'get', 'feeling', '2', 'week', 'ish', 'want', 'friday', 'go', 'fabric', 'dnb', 'club', 'london', 'female', 'friend', 'take', 'mdma', 'awesome', 'night', 'intention', 'ask', 'friendship', 'get', '7', 'grab', 'coffee', 'chill', 'park', 'bit', 'eventually', 'friend', 'go', 'home', 'decide', 'stay', 'spend', 'day', 'london', 'zoo', 'good', 'day', 'go', 'evening', 'premise', 'watch', 'eurovision', 'lie', 'bed', 'decide', 'ask', 'want', 'friendship', 'say', 'yes', 'spoon', 'kiss', 'etc', 'sex', 'foreplay', 'like', 'lot', 'intimate', 'contact', 'spend', 'sunday', 'finally', 'leave', 'home', 'evening', 'spend', 'basically', 'day', 'bed', 'cuddle', 'work', 'tuesday', 'tuesday', 'go', 'film', 'reason', 'date', 'little', 'give', 'real', 'positive', 'sign', 'good', 'time', 'feel', 'reason', 'ask', 'want', 'alton', 'tower', 'saturday', 'agree', 'good', 'sign', 'bit', 'confused', 'admittedly', 'good', 'form', 'put', 'tiredness', 'suicide', 'tuesday', 'mdma', 'hope', 'want', 'come', 'needy', 'ask', 'feel', 'etc', 'feel', 'like', 'leave', 'saturday', 'good', 'day', 'go', 'consideration', 'have', 'ask', 'want', 'hotel', 'friday', 'early', 'saturday', '4', 'hour', 'drive', 'sure', 'proceed', 'game', 'want', 'good', 'shot', 'load', 'common', 'terrible', 'read', 'sign', 'downfall', 'wonder', 'read']"
481,8jsovw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jsovw/my_ex_22m_and_i_23f_are_trying_to_remain_friends/,"My ex (22m) and I (23f) are trying to remain friends after the breakup, I’m afraid I’m moving on a lot faster than he is though","Okay this might turn into a long post.

So my ex and I met online about 4.5 years ago. We were together for 4 years (yes, we did meet numerous times) and broke up in December of last year (2017). We had a great connection from the start and I love him dearly but our connection just worked better as a friendship imo. When we agreed to try a relationship we also agreed that it would be difficult and if things didn’t work out we’d try to remain friends after. 

Our breakup was friendly/peaceful, we just agreed it wasn’t the right time in our lives. He didn’t want to “take a break” from talking though so we attempted going straight into a friendship. Although I love him dearly I’ve come to realize that I don’t love him as a partner, just a very close friend, and I’ve moved on. I still miss him occasionally but I think that’s normal after 4 years of dating someone. I just don’t see a future with him ever happening though and I’m totally okay with just being friends, dating other people, etc.  However I think he’s still more hung up on me than he’s willing to admit. He’s told me he has dating profiles set up but I’m afraid he has this idea in his head that there could still be a chance for us down the line even though I’ve told him the chances of that are awfully slim. 

I don’t want to lose him over this and I’m afraid that, with us being 3000 miles apart where it’s already difficult to maintain a “normal” friendship, dropping contact for a while will cement that loss of contact and we won’t ever manage to be friends. We have boundaries and whatnot that we’ve discussed and agreed on for what’s appropriate and not appropriate as friends vs couple too, if that makes a difference. 

We don’t talk as frequently and when we do it’s pretty much only texting, very infrequently a phone call only if it’s something complicated and important. We’re still friends on social media. We’re both still friends with each other’s friends and family on social media. When we do talk we don’t reminisce on the relationship, we avoid sexual topics, etc. We don’t do birthday/holidays gifts anymore. We don’t even share selfies with each other one-on-one. Those sorts of boundaries. 

I guess my question is how do I handle this situation? I’m okay with it the way it is but I’ve moved on enough to where I’m comfortable being friends and sharing my life with him as I would any other friend of mine but I don’t want to push that on him if he’s not ready. I’ve suggested taking time for himself where we break contact altogether for a couple months or so but he refuses and always says he’ll find a way without doing that. Is trying to remain friends this way a good idea? What would you recommend we do? 

Tldr; 23f & 22m met online, 4.5 years together, tried to go straight into friendship after friendly breakup and I’ve moved on but I feel he isn’t moving at the same rate. I’m worried trying to stay friends may be causing it but he won’t take an extended break from communication. Thoughts?

(reasons I can’t say much is because they’re on reddit as well, and would know this pertains to them) 

Well after we have broken up we still see each other every other couple of days but they’re talking to other people meanwhile I haven’t been talking or socializing with anyone, I know they’ve been on a couple of dates with other people... but the problem is since they’re talking to other people and I haven’t been since we broken up; we still have sex every now and then and occasionally talk... I’m at their place right now spending the night and while they were on their phone a couple of time while I’ve been here; I’ve seen a certain person that they’re talking to several times pop up on their screen.. and it actually is making my heart sink right now and I don’t know how to deal with it, I feel like obviously they like this person to be continuously talking to them and I think it’s the only person they’re talking to since I haven’t seen any other name pop up besides that one person. I actually feel like leaving right now, never talking to them and to lose all contact for their sake..... and mine, I guess... it’s like every time I come over I just hurt myself more and more... I feel like it doesn’t phase them, or it does but they’re trying to move on... somehow.... sorry, my mind is all jumbled up right now, and just trying to say everything that comes to my mind.... anyways, I just need to know since I was the person to fuck everything up and they have constantly told me since we broke up they don’t want anything to do with me, or regret that we are still fucking around, and how much they don’t want me, but also still miss me and love me... how am I supposed to deal with a situation like this? Should I keep hoping they come around? Or should I cut my losses and lose contact? Again, I was the fuck up and they didn’t do anything wrong in our relationship, because of that I’ve been trying everything and giving my all to salvage it, but they said nothing can change their mind.... I don’t know what to do. Just figured I should just get a second opinion.... I know this isn’t healthy for either of us... but I wish I could make things right even though they say I can’t because of how much they don’t trust to be with me....

Just please help me out on this, I don’t think I can handle this hurt and going back and forth with them any longer. I feel like it’s either we end everything or they fucking try to work it out with me.... but I feel like they wouldn’t want to work anything out anymore....

Over the past two years we’ve just had casual conversations and been involved in numerous group activities (athletic team). She’s invited me to train with her twice over the past 2 months, basically because we were training for the same track event.  She’s a super talkative and out going person, and I’m a little bit of the opposite. 

A couple of days ago my friends and I had an end of year party and I was pretty blasted drunk, and  she claimed she was high. During the party she found me stumbling around with a bloody leg (don’t know how),and took me outside to clean me off. She then helped me walk 300m back to my place (trying to hold me up). She helped me on to my bed where she gave me a bucket (in case for throw up). At this point I was almost blackout; she then sat on the edge of the bed with me while I was laying down, and was caressing/massaging my hair trying to comfort me. Eventually my roommate came in and told her to leave even tho she insisted that she stayed. I remember her saying she didn’t want anything bad to happen to me.

Is this something that being high would induce? (Playing with hair) I’ve never been high.

Keep in mind this is the second interaction of the night after I greeted her at the door.

Also consider,
- she drove me home once before when I was drunk, and took a backwards route to drop off others before me. 
- she’s always been a helpful person to most people 
-I tend to overthink everything

Does she like me?

Like most people, I eventually want a 'romantic' partner who I consider my best friend or other half.

She and I would explore this crazy life together. Over the months and maybe years, we'd meet new people, make new life plans, see new cities, try new hobbies and foods. Etc, etc, etc.

Or, depending on her interests and goals, maybe a 100&#37; different list. Nobody knows those future events, but I do crave an awesome companion to face that future with me.

All sounds normal so far?

Here's where things get weird.

I had a pretty traumatic and unstable childhood, due to 100 reasons I won't bore y'all with. I'm 26 years old now. There was a lot of sexual trauma in my early childhood years, which my therapist believes led to some serious sexual problems \-\- like sex addiction \(extremely, extremely compulsive masturbation and abnormally high sex drive\) and also psychological\-based erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.

I also had a weird humiliation fetish from the sexual trauma, like as early as 8 years old, I had funky daydreams about embarrassing sexual situations.

I've been seeing DOZENS of medical doctors and also psychologists, searching for better solutions my whole entire life.

But the bottom line is that I am UTTERLY incapable of erections and penetration for sexual intercourse, and always have been.  This has led to some VERY EMBARRASSING sexual attempts with ex\-girlfriends in the past.

So, my previous 8 year\-old humiliation fetish about diapers and living in cribs, progressed into a 17 year\-old fetish for very mild cuckolding, which I still have at age 26. Not all that intense Big Black Cock stuff, or the ""turning women into sluts"" pornography version of cuckolding. That super intense porno stuff... that's NOT what I'm about.

I'm talking more about a polyamorous/open relationship, where my partner 100&#37; chooses what is gonna make her happy about the relationship. I do NOT aim to control women. I want her to choose : 1\) how much time she wants to spend together, 2\) who else she wants to date or hookup with, 3\) how serious the relationship grows to be, 4\) anything else that might make her feel uncomfortable or more comfortable.

 I'm NOT interested in forcing my fantasies on others. OK, I'm somewhat interested in some light teasing about my sexual shortcomings, since sexually fetishizing it helps me cope with the painful emotions of these lifelong sexual inabilities.

But I would NEVER force my kinky fantasies on others. I just mostly want my future partner to at least HAVE the option of pursuing physical relationships with other men/women \-\- only if they choose. Yes, I can engage in foreplay and do a lot of sexual stuff still, but since I can't have sex ITSELF, that's a big deal to many people, and I don't want to be a sympathy case where my girlfriend craves actual sex over the years, but 'doesn't want to hurt me' and ends up frustrated for months or years without telling me.

Please help me   .... \*sigh\*

I have no idea how I should address this stuff when I meet new people. Or where I should even look for people who might want what I'm looking for.","['help', 'sense', 'need', 'help', 'phrase', 'sexual', 'preference', 'sexual', 'identity', 'hold', 'seek', 'relationship', 'need', 'know', 'let', 'start', 'like', 'people', 'eventually', 'want', 'romantic', 'partner', 'consider', 'good', 'friend', 'half', 'explore', 'crazy', 'life', 'month', 'maybe', 'year', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'new', 'life', 'plan', 'new', 'city', 'try', 'new', 'hobby', 'food', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'depend', 'interest', 'goal', 'maybe', '100&#37', 'different', 'list', 'know', 'future', 'event', 'crave', 'awesome', 'companion', 'face', 'future', 'sound', 'normal', 'far', 'here', 'thing', 'weird', 'pretty', 'traumatic', 'unstable', 'childhood', '100', 'reason', 'bore', '26', 'year', 'old', 'lot', 'sexual', 'trauma', 'early', 'childhood', 'year', 'therapist', 'believe', 'lead', 'sexual', 'problem', 'like', 'sex', 'addiction', 'extremely', 'extremely', 'compulsive', 'masturbation', 'abnormally', 'high', 'sex', 'drive', 'psychological', '-based', 'erectile', 'dysfunction', 'premature', 'ejaculation', 'weird', 'humiliation', 'fetish', 'sexual', 'trauma', 'like', 'early', '8', 'year', 'old', 'funky', 'daydream', 'embarrassing', 'sexual', 'situation', 'see', 'dozen', 'medical', 'doctor', 'psychologist', 'search', 'well', 'solution', 'entire', 'life', 'line', 'utterly', 'incapable', 'erection', 'penetration', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'lead', 'embarrassing', 'sexual', 'attempt', 'ex', '-girlfriends', 'past', 'previous', '8', 'year', '-old', 'humiliation', 'fetish', 'diaper', 'live', 'cribs', 'progress', '17', 'year', '-old', 'fetish', 'mild', 'cuckolding', 'age', '26', 'intense', 'big', 'black', 'cock', 'stuff', 'turn', 'woman', 'sluts', 'pornography', 'version', 'cuckold', 'super', 'intense', 'porno', 'stuff', 'talk', 'polyamorous', 'open', 'relationship', 'partner', '100&#37', 'choose', 'go', 'to', 'happy', 'relationship', 'aim', 'control', 'woman', 'want', 'choose', '1', 'time', 'want', 'spend', '2', 'want', 'date', 'hookup', '3', 'relationship', 'grow', '4', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'comfortable', 'interested', 'force', 'fantasy', 'ok', 'somewhat', 'interested', 'light', 'tease', 'sexual', 'shortcoming', 'sexually', 'fetishize', 'help', 'cope', 'painful', 'emotion', 'lifelong', 'sexual', 'inability', 'force', 'kinky', 'fantasy', 'want', 'future', 'partner', 'option', 'pursue', 'physical', 'relationship', 'man', 'woman', 'choose', 'yes', 'engage', 'foreplay', 'lot', 'sexual', 'stuff', 'sex', 'big', 'deal', 'people', 'want', 'sympathy', 'case', 'girlfriend', 'crave', 'actual', 'sex', 'year', 'want', 'hurt', 'end', 'frustrated', 'month', 'year', 'tell', 'help', 'sigh', 'idea', 'address', 'stuff', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'look', 'people', 'want', 'look']"
486,8jskjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jskjm/best_friend_21m_is_mad_at_me_21m_because_i/,"Best Friend (21M) is mad at me (21M) because I ""comforted"" his sister (19F) when she came home crying after her boyfriend hit her","I share an  apartment with my best friend Luke \(21M\), his sister Anna \(19F\), and  another girl \(20F\). Luke and I have been friends for 10 years.

Two  nights ago, Luke and I were in the common area when Anna arrived at the  apartment. She went directly to her room without saying anything, but  she was visibly and audibly crying and she had her hair pulled over her  face so half of it was covered.  The apartment has thin walls and Anna’s  room shares one with the common area, so we could still kind of hear  her crying. After  ten minutes of this I asked Luke if he was going to  check on her and he said no, it’s not his problem. There’s  family drama  at the moment between their parents and other sibling. They’ve been  dragged into and are a bit annoyed with each other because they aren’t  on the same side.

I could still hear Anna  crying, but less, like she’d calmed down a bit. I told Luke I was going  to check on her and he just said “whatever”. I knocked on her door and  asked if she was okay \(stupid question\). She let me in and we just kind  of sat in silence for a few minutes and then she said she’d gotten into a  fight with her boyfriend. She was talking really fast and still kind of  crying. Her explanation was really disjointed, but from what I  understood they got in an argument about her meeting a male friend alone  to work on a class project and during the argument her boyfriend  backhanded her across the face. She tried to leave, but he grabbed her,  pushed her up against a wall, and choked her briefly “as a warning”  before he let go and she left. While she was describing all that she  pulled back her hair and showed me her face. There was a mark from his  ring and her cheek was kind of red. She also pulled down the collar of  her hoodie and there were obvious red marks on her throat.

I  stayed in there with her talking for probably two hours. I had to  convince her to break up with him, which took a while. I think she knew  she had to, but was reluctant at first and kept making excuses for him.  When she agreed to that, we went over how she should do it \(obviously  not in person\) and she decided on a text. She has some stuff in his  apartment that she wanted to get before she sent the break up text in  case he decided to destroy it, but she was afraid to go alone in case he  was there. I offered to go with her and we figured out a time for the  next day \(which was yesterday\) when he should be at work and we were  both free to go get her stuff. I thought she should file a police  report, but she didn’t want to.

Yesterday  morning, Luke was really mad at me. He said it was inappropriate that I  went to check on Anna and that I shouldn’t have been in her room with  her for so long. He asked what we were doing in there for two hours and I  just said she was upset and I was trying to help her calm down. He  asked what she could possibly be so upset about that I would take two  hours to deal with it and I hesitated because Anna hadn’t said if I  could tell him and I wouldn’t share anyone’s personal stuff without  explicit permission. I must have hesitated for too long because he got  even more mad. He said it was ridiculous that I wouldn’t tell him and  that it didn’t even matter, because it wasn’t my place to check on her  and “comfort” \(his word, I don’t think I did much of that\) her anyway. I  agreed and said it was his place, but since he wasn’t doing anything I  figured I should step in. He decided we were done talking about it after  that. I know that was rude and I shouldn’t have said it, but I was  annoyed that I was getting chewed out for trying to help someone and I  would never ignore either of my little siblings if I saw them crying  like that. Luke was probably right that I shouldn’t have gone to check  on her in the first place. I was just really concerned and I guess the  “crying teenager” thing made whatever big brother instincts I have kick  in. I really felt like it would be wrong not to at least ask if she was  okay.

Luke’s been avoiding me since that  conversation yesterday morning. Every time he’s had to talk to me since  yesterday he’s done it in as few words as possible. I feel like I should  just apologize to smooth things over, but I’m afraid if we start  talking again he’ll ask me what Anna was crying about and I still can’t  answer. We got her stuff yesterday and she sent the break up text, but  she still must not have told Luke what happened because I don’t think  he’d be so mad at me for trying to help if he knew.

Should  I apologize to Luke for “overstepping” with Anna or just wait and hope  it blows over? He’s been my best friend for ten years and I really don’t  want him to be upset with me. The only other solution I can think of is  to ask Anna to tell Luke what happened so he won’t be so mad at me, but  she’s dealing with enough right now and I don’t want to pressure her  into telling if she doesn’t want to.

TL;DR:  Friend’s sister was crying, I checked on her because he wouldn’t, found  out her boyfriend hit her and spent a while talking her through what to  do. Friend is now mad that I was “comforting” her and won’t tell him  why.","['good', 'friend', '21_m', 'mad', '21_m', 'comfort', 'sister', '19_f', 'come', 'home', 'cry', 'boyfriend', 'hit', 'share', 'apartment', 'good', 'friend', 'luke', '21_m', 'sister', 'anna', '19_f', 'girl', '20_f', 'luke', 'friend', '10', 'year', 'night', 'ago', 'luke', 'common', 'area', 'anna', 'arrive', 'apartment', 'go', 'directly', 'room', 'say', 'visibly', 'audibly', 'cry', 'hair', 'pull', 'face', 'half', 'cover', 'apartment', 'thin', 'wall', 'anna', 'room', 'share', 'common', 'area', 'kind', 'hear', 'crying', 'minute', 'ask', 'luke', 'go', 'check', 'say', 'problem', 'family', 'drama', 'moment', 'parent', 'sibling', 'drag', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'hear', 'anna', 'crying', 'like', 'calm', 'bit', 'tell', 'luke', 'go', 'check', 'say', 'knock', 'door', 'ask', 'okay', 'stupid', 'question', 'let', 'kind', 'sat', 'silence', 'minute', 'say', 'get', 'fight', 'boyfriend', 'talk', 'fast', 'kind', 'crying', 'explanation', 'disjoint', 'understand', 'get', 'argument', 'meeting', 'male', 'friend', 'work', 'class', 'project', 'argument', 'boyfriend', 'backhand', 'face', 'try', 'leave', 'grab', 'push', 'wall', 'choke', 'briefly', 'warning', 'let', 'leave', 'describe', 'pull', 'hair', 'show', 'face', 'mark', 'ring', 'cheek', 'kind', 'red', 'pull', 'collar', 'hoodie', 'obvious', 'red', 'mark', 'throat', 'stay', 'talk', 'probably', 'hour', 'convince', 'break', 'take', 'think', 'know', 'reluctant', 'keep', 'make', 'excuse', 'agree', 'go', 'obviously', 'person', 'decide', 'text', 'stuff', 'apartment', 'want', 'send', 'break', 'text', 'case', 'decide', 'destroy', 'afraid', 'case', 'offer', 'figure', 'time', 'day', 'yesterday', 'work', 'free', 'stuff', 'think', 'file', 'police', 'report', 'want', 'yesterday', 'morning', 'luke', 'mad', 'say', 'inappropriate', 'go', 'check', 'anna', 'room', 'long', 'ask', 'hour', 'say', 'upset', 'try', 'help', 'calm', 'ask', 'possibly', 'upset', 'hour', 'deal', 'hesitate', 'anna', 'say', 'tell', 'share', 'personal', 'stuff', 'explicit', 'permission', 'hesitate', 'long', 'get', 'mad', 'say', 'ridiculous', 'tell', 'matter', 'place', 'check', 'comfort', 'word', 'think', 'agree', 'say', 'place', 'figure', 'step', 'decide', 'talk', 'know', 'rude', 'say', 'annoy', 'get', 'chew', 'try', 'help', 'ignore', 'little', 'sibling', 'see', 'cry', 'like', 'luke', 'probably', 'right', 'go', 'check', 'place', 'concerned', 'guess', 'cry', 'teenager', 'thing', 'big', 'brother', 'instinct', 'kick', 'feel', 'like', 'wrong', 'ask', 'okay', 'luke', 'avoid', 'conversation', 'yesterday', 'morning', 'time', 'talk', 'yesterday', 'word', 'possible', 'feel', 'like', 'apologize', 'smooth', 'thing', 'afraid', 'start', 'talk', 'ask', 'anna', 'cry', 'answer', 'get', 'stuff', 'yesterday', 'send', 'break', 'text', 'tell', 'luke', 'happen', 'think', 'mad', 'try', 'help', 'know', 'apologize', 'luke', 'overstep', 'anna', 'wait', 'hope', 'blow', 'good', 'friend', 'year', 'want', 'upset', 'solution', 'think', 'ask', 'anna', 'tell', 'luke', 'happen', 'will', 'mad', 'deal', 'right', 'want', 'pressure', 'telling', 'want', 'tl;dr', 'friend', 'sister', 'cry', 'check', 'find', 'boyfriend', 'hit', 'spend', 'talk', 'friend', 'mad', 'comfort', 'will', 'tell']"

491,8js95v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8js95v/newly_married_wife_suddenly_gay/,"Newly married wife ""suddenly"" gay?","Hi r/relationship_advice,

This is going to be a little bit of a long post, so sorry in advance. Also, apologies if this is the wrong place to post this. If I should post this somewhere else, please let me know.

I \(30M\) and my wife \(26F\) have been married for 7 months. Before we were married, we were both \(or so I thought\) happy in our relationship of 8 years. We didn't live together before we got married \(both lived with our parents while finishing college\), but still had sex on a regular basis \(average 2x per week\), and spent almost every day together outside of class/work. She always seemed to be really into sex and initiated it 50&#37; of the time, if not more.

The year we spent planning our wedding we didn't have as much sex, but were still hanging out every day \(schedules changed, and it was harder to find alone time\).

We got married and then started having issues with the frequency of sex, which dropped to once every 2 weeks or so. Each time was still really good for both of us though. I bought this to her attention and we agreed to work on increasing our sexy time, which did get better, but only a little. We still spent almost all of our free time together and I thought she was happy for the most part. She has always been an excellent communicator, and we have never had any issues working through rough patches.

This all changed almost over night last February. She began to distance herself, and has slowly been withdrawing from our relationship. Our sex life is dead \(once in the past 3 months, at my initiation, and we were both pretty drunk\). She started going out with some friends from work multiple times a week, and, eventually, every weekend day/night. When I tried \(multiple times\) to talk to her to find out what was wrong, her standard response was always ""I'm fine"". Well, one of her newest friends is a lesbian who recently broke up with her girlfriend. I didn't have any problem with them hanging out, because I trusted my wife.

Cut to last Sunday. She sits me down and tells me that we are separating, that she is questioning her sexuality, has been very depressed ever since we got engaged, and needs some time to figure things out. She has asked me not to contact her in the meantime.

Needless to say, I am devastated. For me, this came on so fast and was completely unexpected. I am just trying to cope and understand what is happening. 

So my question is, is it likely that after being happy together for 8 years, and having a healthy sex life, that someone could be gay?I have no close gay/lesbian friend to ask about this.

If anyone has any perspective on this, I would really appreciate it.

If there are questions or specific details needed, I will try to provide them.

The end of senior is approaching and there is less and less time to see my best friend. Understanding that I won’t see her again for 2 years, I made a plan to have a night time picnic in a park that we love. I put extra thought into everything because we haven’t hung out for a few months plus this was our last one. I told her my plan today, and she immediately shut me down and said no. Apparently her mom will only allow her to hang out one last time because she’s been going out a lot. My best friend chose to hang out with her two girlfriends. I kept saying make an exception for me, and I tried to convince her to changing her mind. She didn’t even consider to ask her mom if she could hang out one more time with me. At this moment I literally started tearing up because I definitely did not expect this answer. She probably didn’t see me cry because I turned around but I think it was obvious. We didn’t talk for a few minutes l then she said I should finish my project, so I left saying ok. I’ve never felt this sad since my grandma died earlier this year because it almost feels like she’s trying to cut our relationship apart.

I’ve been unhappy in my marriage. I married my best friend in hopes that it would turn into love. For church,safety and peer pressure reasons. 

It hasn’t. It’s gotten to the point where even him touching me makes me flinch. (He(28m) has never hurt me he’s just touchy it’s his love language. I in the other hand hate being touched in general.) 

We talked and agreed to a kind of soft ball separation. Since we have to young kids we figured we would live together like roommates till the youngest in school and I can finish my degree. 

So here is my problem. I feel sad about it. The thought of leaving. We’ve been through a ton of stuff together and grown a lot. We can still communicate great but acknowledge that we both feel starved for love. He has actually even looked at new places and seeing who would be up to date. Which is crazy he went from sobbing to this in a little over a week. I’m happy for him. which is why I don’t understand this state of loss that I’m in. 

I’m afraid for our small kids and how it will affect them. Scared about not seeing them every day. I’ve been a SAHM for 6 years now. My whole life has revolves around them. The though of them just being... gone for days on end makes me want to cry.

I wanna say majority of the time, we have no problems. We are best friends and get along great. But being with him is also like being with a ticking time bomb.. you never know when he’s going to blow up. He gets mad fairly easily at little things. Some examples are when he’s playing a game and loses, he will literally throw his phone or game controller across the room (he’s broken 2 phones throughout our relationship). Or if we’re at the store and can’t find parking, there have been times where he would throw a fit and say “f this, we’re going home.” And he’d just leave. He has NEVER been physical with me or anyone in his life so I’m not worried about that. But sometimes it’s just so mentally exhausting having to try and calm him down and usually he will just blacklash at me by telling me to just leave him alone. Whenever he has a fit, I have learned to not say anything and to give him a couple min or hours to calm down and then he will apologize. But like I said, it’s just so mentally and emotionally draining constantly having to watch what I say or do and not even being able to talk to him when I just want to comfort him. Sometimes I’ll start crying and he will get even more mad. I know it’s because he knows he’s wrong bc he always says “I know I’m a piece of shit.” But has a hard time saying sorry right away. And I know he acts this way bc growing up, his family never showed him any affection or acknowledgment and instead of being proud, they would tell him he could do better.

Not very smart of him, no, and I grilled him on communication, but after a while of thinking and clearing up that I do want to have kids further down the road when I’m financially stable and able to avoid vaginal birth, I gave him another chance. It’s been almost 2 months and he hasn’t given me any real reason to distrust him since but I still get shaky and nauseous when I get the slightest sliver of paranoia in my head that he’s talking to people behind my back. I feel the need to check his phone/facebook/dating app accounts but I REALLY, really, don’t want to be that kind of person. I don’t want it to drive me insane, and it’s not good for either of us, but how do I ease my mind? I know we haven’t been together very long, but I can see a lot of potential if we’re both willing to put in the effort. It’s just a matter of me figuring out how to trust again at this point.

How do I reconcile this?,"Hi, all. I posted this on the subreddit relationships but it got locked for some reason. Here was my original post: 

Hi everyone. I’m in a very distressing situation right now and was hoping to get some advice on how to deal with my daughter. She is a 21 year old college student dating a guy who's half black and half white and I am worried about her and horrified. 

To give some background information, my daughter is Korean American. Although I've always hoped and wished she would stay rooted in her Korean heritage and culture, the majority of her friends have always been non\-Asian people. Of course she has had Asian friends, but the majority of her friends have been of all different races and cultures. Admittedly, I have never spoken Korean to her so she doesn't speak a lick of Korean, but I did bring her up in a Korean church where she was bullied and excluded by the girls because she has always been taller \(she's 5'10\), naturally more darker skin, and lighter hair \(her father is mostly Korean but has some European ancestry which explains why she looks a little different\). They also made fun of her for not being able to speak Korean and because she's not a fan of K\-pop. I feel like these negative experiences has caused her to shun Korean or Asian culture in general, and it breaks my heart.  

In fact, most of her friends in elementary school were Latina, in middle school her best friend was Persian and in high school she was on the volleyball team so her friends were either white or Hispanic. She claimed in high school that she didn't belong or ""fit in"" with the Asian crowd because their interests were different, and now she goes to a predominantly white college and is in a white sorority so most of her friends are non\-Asian. 

This is very saddening and frustrating to me because I have always envisioned her being engrossed in the Asian community. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have an issue with her being friends with people of all races, but it seems like she's almost TOO open\-minded and liberal. To me, when it comes to marriage I feel like the best match for her would be with an Asian man. 

My worst fear came true when she told me a couple weeks ago that she's getting serious with a guy. I felt my heart drop when she showed me a picture of him, and he was black. I highly disapprove of this relationship, and I tried to get her to break up with him by telling him that he would cheat on her and doesn't love her for who she is as a person. That didn't seem to work, because she just told me that I am ignorant and she's tired of my racist attitude. 

I just can't come to terms with this, and I told her how marriage is difficult and that culturally she is more Korean than she thinks. I'm so appalled by her lack of standards\-\- she's a beautiful girl and out of everyone she chooses to be with a black man, it's almost as if she's getting back at me for all those times I've hurt her in the past. she could have any Asian guy she wants, but instead she settles for someone who will most likely leave her in the end. 

She claims that she loves him because he's intelligent, ambitious, loyal, trustworthy, fun and adventurous. He did go to an Ivy League college and works as a software engineer, but I can't help but to see him as an outsider and someone that is not meant for my daughter. I explained to her that her family will all laugh at her and that this will be an embarrassment to our whole family, but she refuses to see my side. How do I get her to see my side and understand how crucial culture is to marriage?

I do realize that I may get a lot of people who will hate on me because I’m racist. I’m sorry but this is how I was brought up and how my culture is like. Please be compassionate because just because I’m racist it doesn’t mean I can’t be upset or fearful about my daughter’s reputation or future. 

TL;DR: My \(F55\) daughter \(21 F\) is dating a black man and I believe she's making the wrong choice in the future because of cultural differences.

3 months ago my landlords got a dog and it as never liked me, it is small and about 2 years old. I am in school right now and never home enough to get to know the dog well enough but I try and pet him when he can, the problem is whenever he sees me he barks uncontrollably. I usually ignore him and run into my room. The dog will sit outside my room and bark until I spray him with water or the landlord gets him

**There is a video camera by the door which the landlord was apparently watching at the time**, most likely due to the access barking of his dog.

MY landlord texted me furiously from work shortly after.

I know there is no justifying kicking a dog and I even have my own dogs back at home that I love and would never hurt. Maybe months of the dog barking, biting and chasing me got to me.

I move out in a month but I need to be able to live here until then. Please help me work this out, I know there is no coming back from this and I do not know what to do or how to calm things down with my landlord

We've had this issue for some time now and we have both tried many different solutions to fix the fighting. I'm not sure what to do.

&nbsp;

For the most part, the fighting is due to either miscommunication or due to the fact that we both have a very sarcastic sense of humor and we offend one another. A fight generally starts over about something extremely small, but blows up way out of proportion due to the fact that we both get passive aggressive or make small jabs that hurt one another. I also have a tendency to always want to be right and it is something I have struggled with for a long time. I am seeing a psychiatrist to deal with this issue and some of my other issues in life.

&nbsp;

We both have realized in the past that we do this, but time after time we do it to one another and hurt each other. we both love each other and really want to spend the rest of our lives together, but at times, it seems like nothing will ever remain permanent because we can't get over small petty fights that blow up into something huge.

&nbsp;

She tells me that I really struggle with comforting her. Honestly, I agree. When she gets upset I do not know what to do because if I do not understand the problem it's hard for me to fix it. She's told me that I don't need to fix the problem, but when I try to apologize or make her feel better she says I sound sarcastic. I can't say she's wrong, but I really do try to make her feel better, I just don't understand the problem completely so it comes off as insensitive. I've tried asking her what I can do to comfort her in the future, but she says that if I can not come up with it on my own then it will make her mad because she knows that I am only doing that because she gave me the advice.

&nbsp;

I also think that she is a little over sensitive. There are a lot of times where she will get mad over something extremely small that  I do not think is worth fighting over. I have trouble with apologizing of comforting her because I feel like it's unfair when she says things like that to me I am perfectly fine but when I do it to her it offends her and I end up apologizing.

&nbsp;

All in all, I really do love this girl and I am certain that she feels the same about me. We've been together through thick and thin, and this is the only problem that we have. I really wish I knew the answer to solving these stupid little fights. What can we do about this? I'm open to any changes at all. I know i'm not perfect and I have my own issues to work on.

516,8jr2kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jr2kv/i_23m_feel_like_im_in_an_abusivetoxic/,I (23M) feel like I'm in an abusive/toxic relationship with my girlfriend (20F) that I am living with,"Hello, everybody.

After a couple of years of dating my SO over the internet, we both decided that we wanted to move in together. We both decided that it would be best for her to move across the country to stay with me, since I am attending school and she was not. We both saved up, and she flew out here a little over half a year ago.

The relationship was really great over the internet, and the few times that we visited each other, it was wonderful and I would put them among my happiest memories. After moving in, things were great at first, but started to decline after a few months.

I think the move has been really hard on her. She has had a really hard time making friends, and I feel like because of that she expects to spend a lot of time with me that I don't have as much time for. I'm going to school and working, so I don't have a ton of time to spare, but I do the best with what I can. I enjoy spending time with her, but sometimes it's really stressful because I can feel my schoolwork suffering because she wants to spend 3+ hours every day with me. When I get home at 6 p.m., sometimes I need to focus on schoolwork for that night. I want to spend time with her, and I've always had free weekends, but I feel like there's an assumption that when I'm home, I'm spending time with her. I haven't done something I've genuinely wanted to do by myself for over six months. When I tell her this, she seems to get very upset. Any time I put my foot down about needing to spend time on schoolwork or if I want to do something for myself, I end up feeling like I'm doing something wrong. It always leads to a fight.

This was the extent of it, but in the past few months, it's escalated. I feel isolated because I can't see any friends without her absolutely insisting that she tags along. I get accused of lying over things that I'm not lying about. She insists that I spend money in a way that she thinks is responsible. For example, she gets really upset if I eat out after being at school all day and work, and just want something to keep me going (even if it's really cheap). I want to tell her the truth, but every time I do, I get yelled at. I ended up not telling her one time I went to McDonald's, she found the bag in my car, and we fought for two days over it. She demanded I show her my bank statement, and when I denied because I think that's very controlling, she wanted to break up with me. When I didn't beg for her to stay, she started sobbing saying that I didn't care about her.

I share my Spotify with her, and she saw that I was listening to Billie Eillish, a 15 year old girl who makes music that I like, and accused me of being a creep/pedophile. After fighting for hours, I said I wouldn't listen to her if it meant that much to her. She apologized once she got what she wanted, but the next day she thought I listened to her by my Spotify history (I didn't), and I walked out of a lecture to a barrage of accusatory texts calling me a liar, a pedophile, and a creep.

This happened today, and it's made me just not want to go home. I feel trapped and isolated. I haven't spent time with friends for months, and I'm scared to tell them what's going on because I know she goes through my phone. Our lease ends at the end of the month, and her father has a plane ticket to visit around that time. Part of me thinks that if I can hold out until then, then things will be okay. After today, though, I don't want to do anything. I've been at work for hours past when I get off just to avoid going home.

Oh, and it's worth mentioning that she's hit me a few times when we've fought. She's a girl and small so it doesn't hurt me, but it's really awful and breaks my heart every time.

We’ve been together about three years. Everything is great. I recently gave birth to our son, [M/7 weeks] and after going through the pregnancy and birth and, now, the postpartum period, I am extremely homesick. I’ve always preferred my hometown to the city we live in now, but I’m really feeling it. 

Our support system here consists mostly of his mother and a friend of his. I don’t know much of his family, they weren’t interested in having a relationship with me until after the baby was born. I never really got the opportunity to make a lot of friends, because I work for a pretty small company. Everyone there is very nice, but does their own thing. 

My brother back home has a son who is the same age as our boy. I want them to grow up together and be friends. I miss my mom and dad and friends. I haven’t been back to visit in almost a year and maybe that’s playing a part also, but I really really want to raise our son near my family. 

I don’t know how to approach him about this. I’m sure he’ll say no, and I can’t say I blame him, but I want this badly enough to give it a try. 

TLDR: I moved across the country three years ago. My boyfriend and I had a baby, I am very homesick, and after seeing how little support we have here, want to move back to my hometown as a family, but I have to convince my boyfriend.

She texted me saying how it was a big deal to her and I told her that making a big deal out of it isn't going to change anything. We usually talk on the phone a couple times a day and text throughout the day. Now we are barely communicating.

The title pretty much explains it. My girlfriend of nearly 6 years, who I had been living with for nearly 3 years, broke up with me out of the blue around two and a half months ago.

Since then, I’ve crossed the line with her, nothing we hadn’t done before necessarily, but I still crossed the line, as we weren’t in a relationship anymore.

She’s my best friend, and I still love her, but I’m not where she saw me being in life.

She says that maybe one day if I get my life together, that she will fall in love with me again.

Regardless, I want to better my life, but right now my motivation is still her, until she moves on.

There’s obviously a lot more to the dynamic, and feel free to inquire, but I don’t know who else to turn to, I’ve definitely shown my paranoid side in front of her and her mom.

Any advice on what to do? I don’t want to throw away the relationship that we both thought was going to result in marriage and a happy life together, but I don’t want to wait for something that might never come.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

I posted on r/teenrelationships but I figure I should here too.

So I \(17F\) have a sort of online relationship with a guy really far from me \(17M\). We met on discord about 8 months ago. At the time I was struggling with some depression and social anxiety to the point where I had literally zero friends because I would never talk to anyone. I figured I should at least try to make an online friend or two and he was like the first person who I got along pretty well with. I was pretty desperate for companionship so I probably would have liked anyone who bothered to talk to me. So we hit it off and talked a lot. He was having a lot of the same issues as me, loneliness, depression, etc so we understood each other, but it also caused a lot of problems. Time went by, I started counseling and medication and I started to get better. We talked less and I felt like there was less and less we had in common. I really wanted to love him, and I thought I did, but I just don't know.

We had made plans to visit over the summer but it seems pretty unlikely at this point. We had both made promises to never leave each other, we both thought we'd move somewhere and be together and be happy, but that doesn't seem like it will happen. It's like we don't have chemistry anymore. It might be my fault because I still suck at communication and interaction with other people. I have no idea how he feels, but I think he thinks everything is fine. We've become such a big part of each others lives and I feel like I can't leave him, like I'm obligated to stay because I made promises. He's also told me I made him way less depressed and his life is so much better since he met me. I don't know how much of it is true or how he'd react if I did leave.

I feel like a really shitty person because he's genuinely sweet and cares about me. I feel like I should at least meet him and see how it goes, and maybe it'll be different if we're together in person. Deep down I don't want to stay and I really hate that. I wish I could love him. He's all I have, he's the only interaction i have with a peer. I don't know if anyone else will ever love me. I just don't know what to do.

any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.","['know', 'online', 'relationship', 'respond', 'post', 'feel', 'like', 'chest', 'post', 'r', 'teenrelationship', 'figure', '17_f', 'sort', 'online', 'relationship', 'guy', 'far', '17_m', 'meet', 'discord', '8', 'month', 'ago', 'time', 'struggle', 'depression', 'social', 'anxiety', 'point', 'literally', 'zero', 'friend', 'talk', 'figure', 'try', 'online', 'friend', 'like', 'person', 'get', 'pretty', 'pretty', 'desperate', 'companionship', 'probably', 'like', 'bother', 'talk', 'hit', 'talk', 'lot', 'have', 'lot', 'issue', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'etc', 'understand', 'cause', 'lot', 'problem', 'time', 'go', 'start', 'counseling', 'medication', 'start', 'well', 'talk', 'feel', 'like', 'common', 'want', 'love', 'think', 'know', 'plan', 'visit', 'summer', 'pretty', 'unlikely', 'point', 'promise', 'leave', 'think', 'happy', 'like', 'happen', 'like', 'chemistry', 'anymore', 'fault', 'suck', 'communication', 'interaction', 'people', 'idea', 'feel', 'think', 'think', 'fine', 'big', 'live', 'feel', 'like', 'leave', 'like', 'obligate', 'stay', 'promise', 'tell', 'way', 'depressed', 'life', 'well', 'meet', 'know', 'true', 'react', 'leave', 'feel', 'like', 'shitty', 'person', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'care', 'feel', 'like', 'meet', 'go', 'maybe', 'different', 'person', 'deep', 'want', 'stay', 'hate', 'wish', 'love', 'interaction', 'peer', 'know', 'love', 'know', 'advice', 'thought', 'appreciate']"

She seemed  shy and introverted, so I never gave her a second thought. But then one day she joined Discord with me and the rest of my buds and we started talking. That night we talked for hours. We became friends that night. We continued to talk and text each other for months after that, learning more and more about each other, our insecurities, personalities, etc. We became very close friends. That's when I ran into a problem. I'd fallen in love with this girl. I was awestruck by her, she was the most real person I'd met in a long time. She was beautiful and kind and smart. I was conflicted for a while, trying to figure out my emotions and trying to figure out what I was going to do. I left hints in my texts and tried to get her to realize how I felt without saying it outright. She never got the message and I decided to tell her directly. She didn't feel the same way. This crushed me, I felt sad and angry, and guilty because I was angry, but I never told her that. I just continued the friendship not wanting to hurt her. I cared so much for her. Her parents had a messy divorced the year prior and I just couldn't stand to make her life any harder than it had to be. So I stayed to make sure she was ok. And it was like that for months. I helped build her up and helped her to become stronger. She became less and less reliant on me for support. This made me love her even more seeing her become the best she could be. The pain of being in the friendship becoming worse. Since then it's been a never ending limbo. She always makes me smile and laugh, but I always have that hurt in the background, slowly gnawing on my mental strength. I don't want to end the friendship, it feels like betrayal, but I can't stand the pain in my heart. What should I do?

Other incidentals and signs.
- Story about when she broke up with last ex and started dating me didn’t add up at all. 
- Admitted she posts nudes online and never told ex.
- Made out  with 2 different girls, showered and fingered another (a female coworker.)
- Didn’t come home one night, didn’t respond to texts and said she just didn’t have her phone on her and decided to sleep over at her moms house. (Says her phone was down stairs and she didn’t feel like getting it even though she knew I didn’t know where she was).
- Comes home a different night, took a shower leaving her panties out on the bathroom floor, I don’t even have to pick them up to see they are drenched in white residue. 

The last one really gets to me because the next day I ask her if she ever gets wet and gets fluids on her panties randomly and she said absolutely not, but then I told her I saw her panties and that they were drenched and her reaction was pretty weird and suspicious. She turns bright red and says that she does actually get wet some times and that she misspoke and starts changing the subject. She then leaves the room and refuses to talk or look to me.

Serena  is 20 year old shy university student from my work, she has worked there for over a year now. She is easy to talk to once you a conversation starts but she will never instigate conversations, I don't know too much else about her because, well I've known her less than 2 months or so. She is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen, she doesn't know it herself or give that persona off like most people as attractive as her give off. Everyone will compliment her but she doesn't really know how sincere people are being. I only get to see her maybe once a week, otherwise it'll be another 2\-3 weeks before I see, mainly due to how the work ROTA is set and our allocated hours.

I hate living life with regret and with how little I saw her each week, I had to ask for drinks however the opportunity to do it person just got pushed further and further back due to our shift patterns. Instead I asked her out via Messenger \(Facebook\), she said Yes, I was ecstatic. That's where the story would end in my dream world. However as days went on, she slowly starting diverting/avoiding the 'date', making excuses or changing the subject every\-time. I knew something was wrong. Baring in mind, we still hadn't seen each other in person since I asked her out.

Fast forward to the next time I saw her. It was a staff night out, perfect time to find out everything in person and do what's necessary to make the date happen. I walked in ambitiously but instantly noticed her lack of interest/ discontent, not even acknowledging my head  bob, I chalked it up to nothing else than her being shy. Later that night it had become obvious that the entire staff knew about me asking out Serena, I expected this, just not as quick as it happened, people talk, shit happens... Regardless, I was getting a multitude of advise, the majority were telling me to give her time because she broke up with someone a month ago and vaguely 'some' other issues. Which just left me perplexed with more questions than I had before. The same night, Simone, Serena's friend told me that ""Serena just doesn't feel like she clicks with you Ryan"", I took this as a nice way of her saying she's not attracted to me as why else would you turn someone down you have known for less than 2 months.

2 weeks later, I decided to confront Serena tell her how I felt but also address that she didn't feel the same and that's okay we can just be friends. She took it well, all looked good, I also offered to take for those drinks just as friends and she was comfortable with that. Later on we arranged a day, Wednesday as it was a time we were both not working, the night should have entailed a meal and drinks just to get to know each other \(as friends\). She was perfectly sound about that.

Today she has either gone back to diverting or has no common decency/respect for me and it's really annoyed me and put off relationships for a while, platonic or not. What happened was is that she is moving from her student accommodation and must stay there while she moves her stuff. Which is fine, I'm not needy, we don't have to go when I say, however she did not have the fucking decency to tell me until the day before \(Tuesday\), I would have showed up in town centre looking like a mug.

Can someone tell me, is this girl just saying Yes because she doesn't know how to say no?

Should I quit my work and run?

Any obvious indicators as her feelings to me?

\(For girls\) Do you avoid drinking with a guy alone unless it's a date?

I understand I might be infatuated or will get over this, I'm just more trying to ascertain whether this person is healthy for me, is Serena a good person, am I too needy?

Our texts are pretty consistent and he seems interested in wanting to know who I am. I am a divorced woman and only had one relationship, which involved a substantial amount of physical and emotional abuse that I have spent a long time recovering from.

I met this man and we seem to get along great! He seems interested and me and obviously I am interested in him. He took me to dinner the other night and today we slept together. I truly like him and am interested in getting to know more about him. The age gap doesnt bother me in the least because I have always been someone who liked older men due to maturity and educational level. 

He recently invited me a long on a trip and came over to my house. We slept together and he left shortly after. Because of my insecurities and the fact that he got dressed afterwards and left, it raised some huge red flags from me having had this done to me in the past. However, he is a very successful man with a lot of work and also lives about an hour away from me so it is understandable that he would want to go home- he had mentioned before meeting me about wanting to leave at a specific time. He left about 20min prior to that time.

He does text me good morning, good night, send the sweet emojis as well as the compliments and asks how I am, if I'm sick, offers to bring things to me, etc. He is well established in his career and I am just starting mine (at a successful rate if that matters). 

I really like him and want to get closer to him. But I do have my own reservations because I do not want to get hurt again. I guess what I want to know are, in your opinions, what are big red flags that he is just looking for sex or if he is looking for more (plus sex- it's important to me too afterall!).  I dont want to involve feelings if it's not warranted, but I cant help but have hope because we get along so very well with one another.

532,8jq60l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jq60l/sensitive_and_shy_22f_girlfriend_trying_to/,Sensitive and shy [22/f] girlfriend trying to confront [25/m] boyfriend,"Disclaimer: this post is long. I've tried to break it up into pieces, hopefully it is legible and understandable.

---

I'm [22/F] a pretty introverted and shy person raised by a narcissistic mother, which has resulted in me ending up in a few relationships that were abusive, or situations that were sub-par but I did not realize it because I was used to being treated badly. I also tend to read into things too deeply and quite sensitive - it doesn't take much for me to cry (from people other than my immediate family). I've been with my boyfriend [25/M] for just over a year. We got serious fairly quickly and started talking about possible marriage a few years down the road, and moved in together two months ago. He's a great guy, supports me through a lot of my stresses and is generally a very reasonable person - he is also aware of my relationship history. However, over the last few months, I've picked up a small list of things that did not sit right with me, many of which I've been afraid of bringing up with him for a few reasons: 1) I wasn't sure if I was being irrational or bratty, 2) I didn't know how to phrase it coherently in a respective way without dissolving into tears, and 3) I was worried that he'd ask for an example and my mind would go blank. It seems like these behaviours have been happening more often (will describe below) so I'd like to sit him down and have a serious talk about how I feel and try to develop solutions in a mature way.

1) Sharing the housework: when we first moved in together, he was keen on splitting tasks between us evenly, e.g. he cooks/I wash the dishes and tidy the kitchen, etc. No longer - he doesn't seem to contribute much anymore at all and we both work 8 hours every day so it gets hard trying to do a lot of housework by myself when I'm already tired, essentially keeping both of us alive.

2) Little things: because I remember little details about him and I can easily sympathize with others, I end up doing small actions that he notices and thanks me for, such as remembering to buy his favourite cereal even though I don't like it, or plugging his phone in to charge if it's low in the morning (I usually wake up 1-2 hours before him). He was like this too, to a lesser extent, but recently stopped thinking for my interest/being considerate like that.

3) He immigrated to Canada as a young teenager with his family (mother/father/sister) and in the last few years his parents moved back to take care of family. He often video calls them, and occasionally we hang out with his sister. They speak their native language with them, which is totally fine and understandable by me since I'm a child of immigrants myself, but they rarely make any effort to include me in their conversations when I'm in the same room. It's happened that he and his sister have been eating with me at the dinner table and they'll be speaking their language and have me feel clueless; or he will ask if I want to call his parents with him and they'll just speak their language without acknowledging the fact that I'm there and supposedly part of the conversation. I'm really trying my best to learn their language, and they appear to like me, but I feel very alienated and awkward in these situations.

4) He values speed and efficiency, and has recently been getting impatient with me over insignificant things when I don't do something like pass his phone quickly enough. He might give an exasperated sigh or or make a sarcastic comment about it.

5) Recently I put on some weight while stressing over finals in my last year of university (I'm not obese or overweight, just on the larger side of healthy). Thanks to the few abusive relationships I've had over the course of my life, it's taken me years to build up my self-confidence about my size, looks and personality/skills. He knows this. He's recently started to make comments about my size and touching my arms or legs where there's a bit of cellulite. He says it's friendly teasing, but I tell him it bothers me and I'm trying to get more fit, and he apologizes only to do it again a few days later. He's also been making comments about my armpit hair and how he doesn't like it being there so I should go and shave - I don't always have the time to shave because I lead a pretty busy life but it's not gross or excessive, just normal.

6) Finally, he stopped treating me like a girlfriend and started treating me like a housemate. Is this normal, especially so early in a relationship and so soon after moving in? I'm not expecting an infinite honeymoon phase, but he was significantly more romantic and sweet with his words and actions only just a few months ago. We recently had our one-year anniversary, and he made me cry that morning with a passive aggressive comment and then we went for wings to his favourite restaurant (even though he's aware I don't like wings and only go with him because he enjoys them) where I volunteered to foot the bill to break up the silence with the server. Conversations seem to be about him and his infinite love for cars; he doesn't ask how my day was anymore, and he often interrupts me when I'm talking with a reflexive apology. I brush aside a lot of these things because I feel like I would be pushy or a brat for complaining about these types of little things.

He tells me he loves me and wants to marry me every day, and there is nothing wrong with our intimate life, but apart from that it looks like he's given up in a lot of ways on the relationship, or isn't telling me something. I'd like to talk to him in the next few days but I'm just not sure how to start or what to say.

Again, sorry for the long post. Any and all help is appreciated.

TLDR: Not sure how to approach my boyfriend with these issues, and wondering if they're even rational in the first place.","['sensitive', 'shy', '22', 'f', 'girlfriend', 'try', 'confront', '25', 'm', 'boyfriend', 'disclaimer', 'post', 'long', 'try', 'break', 'piece', 'hopefully', 'legible', 'understandable', '22', 'f', 'pretty', 'introverted', 'shy', 'person', 'raise', 'narcissistic', 'mother', 'result', 'end', 'relationship', 'abusive', 'situation', 'sub', 'par', 'realize', 'treat', 'badly', 'tend', 'read', 'thing', 'deeply', 'sensitive', 'cry', 'people', 'immediate', 'family', 'boyfriend', '25', 'm', 'year', 'get', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'start', 'talk', 'possible', 'marriage', 'year', 'road', 'move', 'month', 'ago', 'great', 'guy', 'support', 'lot', 'stress', 'generally', 'reasonable', 'person', 'aware', 'relationship', 'history', 'month', 'pick', 'small', 'list', 'thing', 'sit', 'right', 'afraid', 'bring', 'reason', '1', 'sure', 'irrational', 'bratty', '2', 'know', 'phrase', 'coherently', 'respective', 'way', 'dissolve', 'tear', '3', 'worried', 'ask', 'example', 'mind', 'blank', 'like', 'behaviour', 'happen', 'describe', 'like', 'sit', 'talk', 'feel', 'try', 'develop', 'solution', 'mature', 'way', '1', 'share', 'housework', 'move', 'keen', 'split', 'task', 'evenly', 'e.g.', 'cook', 'wash', 'dish', 'tidy', 'kitchen', 'etc', 'long', 'contribute', 'anymore', 'work', '8', 'hour', 'day', 'get', 'hard', 'try', 'lot', 'housework', 'tired', 'essentially', 'keep', 'alive', '2', 'little', 'thing', 'remember', 'little', 'detail', 'easily', 'sympathize', 'end', 'small', 'action', 'notice', 'thank', 'remember', 'buy', 'favourite', 'cereal', 'like', 'plug', 'phone', 'charge', 'low', 'morning', 'usually', 'wake', '1', '2', 'hour', 'like', 'less', 'extent', 'recently', 'stop', 'think', 'interest', 'considerate', 'like', '3', 'immigrate', 'canada', 'young', 'teenager', 'family', 'mother', 'father', 'sister', 'year', 'parent', 'move', 'care', 'family', 'video', 'call', 'occasionally', 'hang', 'sister', 'speak', 'native', 'language', 'totally', 'fine', 'understandable', 'child', 'immigrant', 'rarely', 'effort', 'include', 'conversation', 'room', 'happen', 'sister', 'eat', 'dinner', 'table', 'speak', 'language', 'feel', 'clueless', 'ask', 'want', 'parent', 'speak', 'language', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'supposedly', 'conversation', 'try', 'good', 'learn', 'language', 'appear', 'like', 'feel', 'alienated', 'awkward', 'situation', '4', 'value', 'speed', 'efficiency', 'recently', 'get', 'impatient', 'insignificant', 'thing', 'like', 'pass', 'phone', 'quickly', 'exasperate', 'sigh', 'sarcastic', 'comment', '5', 'recently', 'weight', 'stress', 'final', 'year', 'university', 'obese', 'overweight', 'large', 'healthy', 'thank', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'course', 'life', 'take', 'year', 'build', 'self', 'confidence', 'size', 'look', 'personality', 'skill', 'know', 'recently', 'start', 'comment', 'size', 'touch', 'arm', 'leg', 'bit', 'cellulite', 'say', 'friendly', 'teasing', 'tell', 'bother', 'try', 'fit', 'apologize', 'day', 'later', 'make', 'comment', 'armpit', 'hair', 'like', 'shave', 'time', 'shave', 'lead', 'pretty', 'busy', 'life', 'gross', 'excessive', 'normal', '6', 'finally', 'stop', 'treat', 'like', 'girlfriend', 'start', 'treat', 'like', 'housemate', 'normal', 'especially', 'early', 'relationship', 'soon', 'move', 'expect', 'infinite', 'honeymoon', 'phase', 'significantly', 'romantic', 'sweet', 'word', 'action', 'month', 'ago', 'recently', 'year', 'anniversary', 'cry', 'morning', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'comment', 'go', 'wing', 'favourite', 'restaurant', 'aware', 'like', 'wing', 'enjoy', 'volunteer', 'foot', 'bill', 'break', 'silence', 'server', 'conversation', 'infinite', 'love', 'car', 'ask', 'day', 'anymore', 'interrupt', 'talk', 'reflexive', 'apology', 'brush', 'aside', 'lot', 'thing', 'feel', 'like', 'pushy', 'brat', 'complain', 'type', 'little', 'thing', 'tell', 'love', 'want', 'marry', 'day', 'wrong', 'intimate', 'life', 'apart', 'look', 'like', 'give', 'lot', 'way', 'relationship', 'tell', 'like', 'talk', 'day', 'sure', 'start', 'sorry', 'long', 'post', 'help', 'appreciate', 'tldr', 'sure', 'approach', 'boyfriend', 'issue', 'wonder', 'rational', 'place']"

While I take less than like 5 minutes to snap a picture and send she'll take upwards of half an hour to take and delete multiple pictures and in the end sends nothing. I know, I seem like a dick because I'm sending my dick and expecting something in return but the ratio is probably about 10:1! I know she's just bailing out because she doesn't want to or whatever but if this is the case, why doesn't she just tell me? 

She told me once she took like 100 pictures and deleted all of them, surely one of them would have been good. She says stuff like ""taking a picture of a dick is easier"" and ""I don't like the picture"" and I try and reassure her she looks lovely.

Eventually the whole thing just results to a prolonged awkward silence as neither of us want to talk any longer. And the worst part for me honestly is, although I don't really mind it, I feel like I'm whoring myself out to her at her request but she's never really doing anything to like return the favour.

So like I (F21) have been broken up with my ex (M22) for some time since June of last year and then we had a major fight in October and the last thing I asked of him was about a week before graduation from our university if him and I could have an actual talk for closure on my end so I can move on. 
He already is living with the girl he cheated on me with so like he doesn't need the closer because he fucked up and cheated and lied but like I felt like I needed to be able to say my peace for he has been talking though my best friend and others to talk with me and only making small talk when ever we would see each other. 
I asked him if he considered us friends like I had in my mind. He only considered us more acquaintances. I asked him to do me one last thing and that was to ask to meet and take for closer because I at least think I deserved that after a lot of the shit he put me though. He said not today, being the day I asked back in the beginning of May. 
Now we come to present day and I noticed he blocked me on Facebook. Before we were friends we have mutual friends too and so like I was able to see him in stuff like yesterday for a friend of ours created and event and I was able to see that he was invited. Now today I watched a friend of mine post and tag him in the post but his name not come up thus showing I am blocked. 
I don't know how to feel about this. 
Obviously I don't need him but like now it just worries me when our mutual friends will have a party or something and I will have the anxeity of might having to see him and if he is there then the girl he cheated on me with is also going to be there and it's just nerve racking for they are both our friends and I am trying to be the adult but like I want this feeling to go away and I don't think it will anytime soon. 

TL;DR Ex blocked me on FB after asking for closure that never happened now feeling anxeity if I should have to see him at mutual friend affairs knowing that the closure didn't happen and that I can't see on FB if he is attending certain events.

I'm polling the community to see if this is a common problem, maybe a known issue, or just specific to me.

Cutting to the chase, I \[30M\] am in a loving relationship with my girlfriend \[33F\], soon\-to\-be fiance and wife. Hurray. I have noticed in myself though that I issues with sex. No idea why they're there. This is not specific to my current relationship, as it has arisen in previous relationships.

In short, whenever I feel not in control while having sex, it can lead to negative emotions. Intense negative emotions. If I orgasm while she's on top, for example, I sometimes have a freakout. I feel hurt, betrayed, and all these strange emotions that come out of nowhere. I've discussed w/ my partner and she understands. I honestly have no idea where it's come from. I've done lots of self\-reflection and meditation on the subject and let go of some of the feelings, but still can't help but feel *hurt* sometimes, like my girlfriend did something to me, even when I know logically that doesn't make sense. The other thing that happens is that after we have sex, if I don't think she had a good time, it contributes to this growing sense of panic. After analyzing the feelings and thoughts in regards to that, I realized that some part of me is reasoning that if she shows that she had a good time, then she must not want to hurt me, and if she doesn't want to hurt me, then I'm safe.

Again, no idea where the feeling comes from. Obviously, sounds like a therapy issue, I know, but I don't have access to that at this point and need to just do some reading and research on my own. Anyone out there experienced something similar, or heard of something similar?

It's been like this ever since I had to leave college early due to illness. She barely ever talks to me because she thinks I'm too negative and gloomy. Granted, I'm not the most positive person in the world. But when you if you were like me and you had to deal with being diagnosed with cancer at 18 and having to tack on two extra years of undergrad because of pneumonia, you'd be pissed off too. We also had an argument while we were out driving. I'm currently 22 and don't have my driver's license but have been taking private lessons. I wasn't doing too well, not looking both ways at a stop sign and she got angry. During the argument, I told her I wanted to get my license to make her happy. She tells me she doesn't care if I get my license and she only told me to get it when I was 16 because ""that's what normal people do"". As if I haven't been dealing with being sick and going to college full time. Yes, I should have gotten it earlier, but who the fuck says that kind of shit to their kid?

I remember the day of my fifth grade graduation. My mom didn't show up. When I came home, she said she didn't show up because she was embarrassed of me because I got in trouble a lot during the fifth grade. Ever since then, all I've tried to do was make her proud of me. Whatever people thought of me didn't matter as long as I was doing good in her eyes. But as she's becoming more and more distant to me, it makes me feel like I don't matter to her anymore. Like I'm simply a burden she's better off without. There's a part of me that wants to make amends with her, but there's another part of me that wants to tell her off.

As a brief background, we are long distance for most of the year as we attend colleges essentially on other ends of the country. Both of us also have our fair share of mental health issues and kind of shitty circumstances. 

In the past three months both of us have seen our mental health decline to the point of us having to medically withdraw from our semesters. Along with the mental health problems, are the toxic coping mechanisms. I personally have socially isolated myself and withdrew from everyone, including her and our communication has suffered. 

With that general malaise, there have also been some major events. For her, it was the death of a close family friend and a very horrible housing situation (which has now been resolved. For me, it was the same death of the family friend, having to put my father in a care home due to declining health and the recent passing of my grandfather.

About a month ago, we got into a major fight and I guess the stress and depression got to me or something, I can’t quite tell you what I was thinking...and I became deeply suicidal and having to walk to the emergency room for my own safety. She tagged along through that hell ride some few thousand miles away and next to helpless. I have been through that same situation with another friend and know how it can scar. I don’t blame her for being hurt, I said hurtful things. 

After that night, a change in medication, some counseling and relocation so we’re actually in the same room, I feel like I’ve been making a slow recovery and trying to mend some of the holes in myself and our relationship. It’s not perfect, but I am truly trying to be better. 

I don’t think she sees it the same way, and can’t get over past hurt (understandably so, it hasn’t been very long) and it’s resulting in a lot of arguments. When one seems to be settled and I think we’re on okay footing, something else blows up and I’m not sure how much more of it I can handle.

She says I’m not fighting for us, and I seem to think my actions and wants are the opposite of that. I have followed through with counselling and help, I am trying my best to touch base about my mood and health, and made the move to close the physical distance, and doing what I can to make us happy. 
This doesn’t seem to be enough and I’m starting to get too tired to keep fighting and kind of want to take up her offer (a repeated one) of going back home, but I also want to salvage this. We are strong together and we can be that again. 

So, does anyone have advice on how we can go about that?

*TL;DR:* My GF and I have gone through some terrible months and I’ve done a lot to unintentionally hurt her. I’m trying to make it right, but seemingly have little headway of room to do so.

Let me explain my situation. I was told about my brother all my life but I’ve always been told to not bother contacting him as he didn’t want any contact, so not been wanted to get let down I didn’t contact him.

Yesterday I sent him a message on a social media platform, didn’t think he would reply, he read it and left it. I thought okay, I got my answer everyone was right.

He’s had no contact with my family for years, I’ve never even seen him in person and I’m 24, he’s not had anything todo with my dad and nothing todo with his mum.

So to my shock he messaged me back, even though I had never met him or spoke to him it made me smile, he replied saying he didn’t know I existed, which I can believe if he didn’t have any contact with my family and still doesn’t.

He’s been talking to me everyday after he’s finished work, only him, his partner, my partner and myself know we are talking, he’s got 3 kids (who I’d like to meet one day).

I get the feeling I’m rambling so I’ll get to the point, after 24 years I’ve spoken to my brother, he’s happy to chat but I’m worried what if I say something that would push him away? What if he never wanted to meet me in person? What if he didn’t want me to meet his kids or wife? I know there’s nothing I could do about that but I want that connection. 

Any advise or wise words are appreciated.

It is going to take a while to recover from this, but I am determined that I will get there eventually.

However. As per the title, we are part of the same sports club.  Neither of us are willing to leave it.  It's a huge part of both of our lives, and for both of us, basically all our friends in this city are from the club.  So he'll inevitably be around.

I can't leave the club - that would kill me.  It's the only thing I have in this city now.  I also don't want to force him to leave the club - whilst what he did tore me into little pieces inside, I'm not vindictive, and it would kill him to have to leave it too.

There have been a couple times where issues have come up and we talk about it and work through it. 

Some background information is that I have been 10 or so years out of dating and was pretty dissatisfied and decided I would die alone and that was okay.

The first year or so of our relationship,

* we had sex almost daily

* I initiated literally every time

* he never turned me down

* he was combating death grip, I guess, because sometimes he couldn't finish

At some point, I guess insecurity got the better of me, and

* sometimes tearfully, sometimes calmly I told him how I was second guessing his interest because he never initiated and asked him to please try for my sake, at least occasionally 

* he told me sometimes he ""never felt anything"" and while I know logically this was a byproduct of the death grip (not to mention at our frequency, unfair to expect him to finish every time), I hate to say it but I've never gotten it out of my head

* he expressed lack of confidence regarding initiating at the ""right time""; I tried to reassure him that almost any time would be right, which was true back then. 

Fast forward through another year and probably half a dozen discussions, and

* he did give up (at least largely) masturbation and can finish consistently 

* I remained the only one initiating and  was still second guessing myself, even though again, he never turned me down. I guess it felt more and more like ""are you even into this, or are you just doing it to make me happy?""

Fast forward another 1-2 years to present, at least a couple more talks, and I don't even know what happened anymore.

* I stopped trying. I figured if he cared, he'd initiate. I let my libido die, because the (perceived) disinterest (built up over the years) just got me so low that it became easier to ignore my sexuality

* we have sex maybe once or twice a week

* he is doing all the initiating, but it seems like it came too little, too late.. 

* I feel like the effort is low (i.e. groping me or pressing his junk against me, rather than any build up) 

* even though I'm not terribly interested anymore, I don't turn him down when he he'd like to have sex

* I've asked him for sexts throughout the day, to send links to any cool porn he discovers since I know he browses constantly, etc. but nothing ever happens. I feel like this would help rekindle my drive. 


Outside of this issue, our relationship is very loving. We still express affection other ways, cuddling, through service, etc. When we do have sex, I'd say there's equal effort as far as activity (taking turns who is on top). 


I don't know what to do. I feel frustrated. I wish my drive was higher like it used to be and I'm beginning to resent that it's not. I'm not sure if he thinks about it at all. This is the one subject we've discussed at length and it doesn't seem like anything changes (whereas we've calmly and successfully worked through plenty of unrelated issues in the past). 


I feel like this is sort of my fault for being insecure and/or having too high of expectations. I also feel like it's sort of his fault for waiting so damn long to put any effort into our sex life. 


I'm not even sure what I'm asking. Maybe we both have somewhat reactive drives? How do two reactive partners make things work? How do I get over the sadness that I've lost some part of me/our relationship? How do I stop blaming him without giving up and blocking out the issue entirely? To be clear, I don't want to talk to him about this anymore (I get that's the go-to advice, but having it not work *again* will only make things worse for me) .. I just want some self management strategies. 

Thanks.

I wanted to break up with him tonight, over text because honestly I wanna end it all now or today because I just cannot do it anymore. It was an emotive abusive relationship and now I'm on the verge of a break down.


I was going to break up some minutes ago but then he said ""They suspended me"" ""I don't wanna live anymore"" and that just made me feel horrible.


The reason why I wanted to break up was because I couldn't cope with the BS:
I created a photography/make up  account so that maybe someone could notice my talent and probably consider me as an employer(?) or maybe a college call me and give me a scholarship.
He criticized me again.

 He never actually appreciated a lot of things about me. He made me change and he made me end friendships. He said that I just wanted to be on social network and that I was loosing time. But I wanna do things like this ans I will continue.


I got really mad because the only good things he says about me are how good I am giving blowjobs, and I lost my patience.


A lot of time has happened that he would threaten me that he would kill himself, he tried to make me believe it as well, and I swear I didn't eat for 5 days (even tho this episode lasted 1 night, I was traumatized and skipped school and meals) because I thought he was dead.


Now if he tells me again that he will kill himself, what do I do? I honestly lost caring about what he says and does but this just wrecks me. What do I do? Please help.. I need to get all my friendships back and all my dreams back. Please. Help.

I have this recurring dream that I have sex with my ex. The thing is, me and this specific ex never HAD sex, but me and my current gf have. This really bothers me because I would never do that to my current gf. I’ve never had an emotional connection like this until I met her. I feel like I have always subconsciously lusted over my previous ex, who had been on and off with me for a good year or so. She was very bad for me, and I know that.

I can’t fully tell if I still have feelings for her or not, because I have had this dream multiple times, and I wake up feeling really guilty. On top of all of this, my gf is suspicious that I still have feelings for her. 

The question is... how can I get rid of these dreams? What do I do? I know having sex with my ex would spread and only ruin my current relationship with the best gf I’ve had, so how do I fix this?

I feel broken, unlovable, and completely lost.","Just a heads up, this is a long post. I am struggling and thinking I may need to go no contact but also scared that that means I have admitted I am the problem and am not lovable.
Here goes. 

I have been having a rough couple of months navigating a relationship that I don't want to end, but feels like it inevitably will / must. I am struggling massively and looking for some response or support or feedback that will help me understand what is going on and what I should do. I am filled with deep feelings of inadequacy. I feel like I am not lovable, and will always be too much for those I care about to deal with.

I met my partner in August when both he and I moved to the same new town. We have had our share of regular couple arguments and disagreements, as well as some that were a little more intense perhaps, due to mental health difficulties we both have (and were aware of about each other from the get go).

He assured me he was here to support me and by all accounts me acted like he was. I had no reason to suspect he was feeling insecure or uninterested in our relationship or may do anything dishonest. Flash back to March when I was cleaning his apartment and found evidence that he went to another province (when he told me he was visiting family) to meet a girl he matched with on Tinder in December (while we were together and happy as far as I was aware). He spent 5 days with her and returned home to me and our relationship carried on as normal until about 2 weeks later when I found the totally shocking evidence of this unsuspected infidelity.
When I confronted him about it, he denied it completely, said he could explain. We had about a week of limited contact while I processed, and then we met to talk in person. He largely avoided the topic and acted as though our relationship was normal and this infidelity had not occurred. I considered for weeks telling the other girl about my existence but held out as I didn't want to act on emotion and cause greater issues.
After about 2 weeks, she reached out to me and said she was his girlfriend. I explained that I was as well, and had been since early fall and had also spent most of my free time with him since meeting in August. We had plans to get a place together and start the next more adult phase of our relationship and all that fun stuff.

She communicated regularly with me in the following weeks, while he continued to feed lies to both of us EVEN WHEN he knew she and I were in contact. She shared with me that he had said I had a boyfriend and was going through challenging times with him and he was just helping counsel us through our difficulties. He then told her that my boyfriend and I had broken up and that he and I hooked up one time and I just wasn't able to get over him. He told her I wasn't stable and I was just ""something he didn't mean to have to deal with"" but assured her he was working on smoothly exiting his life here so he could join her and start the life he never imagined he could have with this woman who amazed him so much in so many ways. (Can I again point out that they matched on Tinder while home for Christmas before returning to their lives some 3,300 kms apart). He told me that she was just a Tinder match, a fun person, but not anyone he knew well enough to say that he loved her. He professed it was a mistake and that he was just feeling insecure in our relationship and wasn't sure it was going to have any longevity. He said he was looking for someone to show him appreciation and so he went on Tinder and started talking to this girl before eventually seeing her but it wasn't serious.

One night after being pressed about the lies, he opened a group chat with both her and I. He basically said that I was fun to have drinks and spend evenings just casually hanging out with and he just didn't want to be another hurt or disappointment in my life so he toughed it out but he didn't want to be with me. He then said that the other girl was truly all he wanted and his days with her were a glimpse into a future he couldn't have even imagine he could have had. I was hurt, and this other girl basically said she was out. She spent several weeks sending me articles about sociopaths and telling me that we both deserved better and need to remain strong and respect ourselves enough to stay away. I expressed that that was incredibly difficult for me living a mere kilometer away from him and having seen him at least for a hello almost everyday since he and I had met.

He and I continued to talk things out and he assured me again that he had made a mistake and was committed to working through things with me. A few weeks ago he told me that the other girl was going to be down in the city (where they both were home for the Christmas holidays) and he felt that he owed it to her to see her in person and give her closure. He said that it was going to be a dinner meeting, and then he would be going to the house he owns about an hour south of where they were to be meeting. I expressed that I was supportive of him going, but fearful that things might change between us, and all the hard work we had been putting into resolving our issues and healing the hurt would be lost. He promised that wasn't the case and he would be back to me when the weekend was over and everything would be okay.
It ended up that they got a hotel together for 3 nights. I was hurt by this. He told me he never said any plan was certain, and that he and she had a great deal to talk about so that is what the did. He also said he wasn't going to share with me what happened but that SHE had share with him some things that I had told her that he and I needed to discuss because I was out of line. That was on April 23rd, and he has refused to talk about anything since but alternates between being loving and coupley with me, and distant and withdrawn. I have asked a few times if we can talk and he has just told me he can't deal with my being emotional and I am not the only one hurting after this situation has unfolded. I have been patient, supportive, kind, loving, understanding, nurturing, and in no way forceful on the matter.
She and I stopped being in contact on the day he returned home. She told me that she had ""started to get some truth from the situation"" and that she ""was too busy trying to explain his behavior with sociopathy, and supporting me to make sure I was okay and so she never experienced her own hurt in the situation."" I kind of fucking hate her to be honest. I feel like they invented this truth that allows them to be together, and she has come to believe that I am all the negative things he told her I was.

I realize now that they continue to be in touch. Many times now he has sat RIGHT BESIDE ME on my couch and messaged her, and then will turn to me and tell me their exchange in one happening between him and his work from CP. I know that he is messaging her because he is right beside me and I am not stupid, and his message exchanges with CP are green and the messages with this woman are blue because they both have iPhones. Last night he spent the entire duration on the hockey game we were watching texting her, occasionally sharing bits of their exchange with me but saying that it was between him and CP. When he headed home at the end of the game, he hugged me and said he was sorry. He asked if I wanted to see him today and I said yes.
I want to see him, but I also want to fucking scream at him and ask him if he really thinks that I am so fucking stupid that he can sit there and text her in front of me and pass it off as an exchange between someone else. I want to ask if I am so fucking worthless that I don't even deserve the truth about where we stand. I feel like I am being played and he is just waiting to fucking abandon me, all while telling her he can't leave me because I am so unstable, and to make it worse she is eating it all up.
This has destroyed my sense of worth and I continue to be mind fucked by it. I need to get away from it but I want to at the same time prove that I am worthy of love and the love I have to give is so deep and real.  What do I do to heal?

557,8johqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8johqq/married_husband_against_moms_wishes_and_now_let/,Married husband against moms wishes and now let down by both,"11yrs ago I decided to get married to my husband but my mom was vehemently against it for various reasons. Example..he was not as qualified as me, his family was from a caste/class they considered as lower than thiers, lesser financial standing etc. 

I never subscribed to these views, but I still tried for 3 yrs to convince her about our alliance. Finally mom asked me to choose and when i chose to get married to him 8yrs ago, she said that my relationship with her is over foreover. And she meant every single word of it. Till date. She has not accepted him. There is no relationship between the families, he is not allowed in my house and my mom does not talk to any of us.

Since she is the leader of the family, no one else including father or brother has dared to accept my marriage either and chose to remain silent spectators.

Post marriage I have always tried to mend my relationship with mom but she humiliates me and   says mean things reminding me how Ive broken her trust. Since childhood i was her darling and she was my best friend until I met my husband and did not share what was brewing (because i wasnt sure initially..).

Meanwhile I moved abroad and had 2 kids but things with mom are still bad. I visited home recently after 2 yrs and mom was happy to play with my kids but still not talking to me. 

When my husband came to pick up my son, she accidently saw him inside the house for a few mins and later blasted me reminding me again how much she hates me.

I feel so saddened by this that i have thought of ending my life. Not once but every time I come home I have cried gallons and spent sleepless nights..stopped eating food for days together and not knowing where to go.

In the meanwhile my husband is a nice guy but thats it. Our romance has faded. There is no sex anymore. He is a good dad but he is not able to engage me mentally or make my life interesting in any way. Yes he follows what i plan... He also supports my career development. But i want to be led, not always lead the way. I earn more than him but after 2 kids i want to take a break yet i feel i cant because we will have to reduce our financial status and lifestyle in that case. So when i think of what i have lost to have him, i doubt if i made the right choice. 

He hates my mom and i am not able to share the details of my interactions with mom becasue i cannot bear his hatred towards her. We fight really really bad when something related to mom comes up. I still love my mom very much and want her back in my life.

But im trapped from both sides. I feel strongly connected with my family and on the other side im trapped with 2 kids and a house in joint ownership with my husband. And i have no avenues to share my feelings from both sides and feel emotionally unfulfilled.

I feel like running away from both mom and husband and just starting life over. Or ending it. This has been going on for 8 years and ive cried too much. Now my kids are seeing this. 

Im visiting home right now for 6 weeks N Today my 2.5yr old son saw me cry all day after my husband came to my moms house and blasted me for not picking up his phone...after which mom blasted me for letting my husband in.

558,8joggm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8joggm/my_boyfriend_and_i_want_to_go_to_the_same_college/,My boyfriend and I want to go to the same college. My sister is giving me constant shit about it. What do I do?,"Hey guys! So I got into two really good universities. One is in Canada one is in the US in Colorado. Before I met my boyfriend I’ve always been obsessed with Colorado, however when I we became really close with each other that obsession also shifted to the beautiful Canada! 

We’ve been together for about 2 years now and we’re really close. He’s helped me changed a lot and into a good person and I think he’s really sweet. Lately though, we’ve been in a shitty fucking limbo. We’ve been arguing a lot, and bumping heads about stupid shit for the past 5 months. It’s been a really tough ride with each other..but I’m still there. He’s the first person to treat me well. Of course he’s human and sometimes he will get a little bit annoyed at habits like 1) exercising when it’s not necessary or if I have too much work 2) if I do things that I shouldn’t be doing rather than focusing on my priorities. He also was annoyed with me at some time because he felt I was always busy and never had time for him. I was also super insecure and jealous and would accuse him of looking at girls etc. I know those are bad things but we also don’t try to focus on it. I don’t wanna make him sound bad because I’ve fucked up too but he’s really a nice person most of the times. 
 
My sister has been arguing with me because she feels I shouldn’t go to university with him cause she feels 1) the university I would be attending in Canada isn’t nearly as great as the one I got into 2) I got into science at Colorado and arts in Canada 3) she thinks it’s not even worth it if I’m unhappy in the relationship. I acknowledge that I should probably be careful when I tell her things about us cause she takes it the wrong way and deems our relationship as 100% shit, but it’s really not. The two colleges are CSU ( col state university and CU (Carleton University) got into psychology on the pre medical track at CSU and Bachelors of Arts honors for psychology at CU. 

I don’t know why but going to Colorado and leaving my boyfriend just doesn’t feel right. He told me I can go to CSU if I want to but it just doesn’t feel good, I feel like I’m really not making the right choice if I do that.  She keeps fighting with me and she also got into CSU and tells me she’s “disappointed if I go to CU”. Part of me feels like I can’t please anyone and I know it’s stupid to “follow” your boyfriend but I truly believe in him and I believe in us and what relationship isn’t going through shit?? I think this is just a petty phase we can both grow from! 

To top it off I didn’t even wanna do pre medical track, my sister is very forceful and told me I won’t make it anymore with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. I want to be a psychologist but she’s INSISTING I become a psychiatrist. It sucks, and I feel like I have no individuality. She keeps blowing up my phone giving me up to 17-58 messages in just a few minutes. Please give your feedback! Thank you.

I was in a two year relationship with a guy who would just lie and cheat on me. I didn’t want to be that girl who brings baggage into her new relationship, but with my ex he would say his ex’s were “just friends” and they would end up being more.He cheated on me with multiple ex’s so I wasn’t too happy when I found out my current boyfriend was still friends with his ex. 
           In the beginning of our relationship we hardly talked about our ex’s. But a couple months down he mentioned he was with her for 3 year and they had planned to move in together in the apartment we our living in. I told him I don’t like to deal with ex’s or any of that bullshit. He told me ok and that he didn’t follow her or talk to her, so I just moved on from the situation. One day I used his computer for work and found photos of him and her. I wasn’t about to throw a fit over old photos, but this was different. They were hidden in a file, and some were of her naked. When I confronted him he said I was crazy and got mad at me for going through his things. I decided to delete the photos cause he was stupid and couldn’t do it himself. But I did notice some of the photos i had seen were on his phone. He had told me they it was an old friend when I asked and deleted them. 
            Later I found out it was her. I decided to let things go. The photos were gone. Later I was on his Instagram and I was mad because of the girls he follows. Then I thought to myself at least he doesn’t have his ex on here. So I looked her up, and BOOM !!! She was there. So I told him to unfollow her and he did and I told him I meant on everything. A few months later BOOM! She’s on another one of his social media. So I told him I’m tired of him lying to me about her, and why was he fighting to keep her in his life or even communication ? He called me crazy again and said he would always love her but she’s just a friend and that they were just not right for each other. I can’t reach him , I can’t tell him the words that get to him about how I feel. 
              I had mentioned he probably still had her number hoping he’d say no and then he says “yeah why does it even matter” at this point I’m getting tired of it, I keep trying but I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to know if this should be something to worry about or am I just overthinking it.","['battle', 'ex', 'know', 'mention', 'previous', 'post', 'want', 'ask', 'year', 'relationship', 'guy', 'lie', 'cheat', 'want', 'girl', 'bring', 'baggage', 'new', 'relationship', 'ex', 'ex', 'friend', 'end', 'more.he', 'cheat', 'multiple', 'ex', 'happy', 'find', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'friend', 'ex', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'hardly', 'talk', 'ex', 'couple', 'month', 'mention', '3', 'year', 'plan', 'apartment', 'live', 'tell', 'like', 'deal', 'ex', 'bullshit', 'tell', 'ok', 'follow', 'talk', 'move', 'situation', 'day', 'computer', 'work', 'find', 'photo', 'throw', 'fit', 'old', 'photo', 'different', 'hide', 'file', 'naked', 'confront', 'say', 'crazy', 'get', 'mad', 'go', 'thing', 'decide', 'delete', 'photo', 'cause', 'stupid', 'notice', 'photo', 'see', 'phone', 'tell', 'old', 'friend', 'ask', 'delete', 'later', 'find', 'decide', 'let', 'thing', 'photo', 'go', 'later', 'instagram', 'mad', 'girl', 'follow', 'think', 'ex', 'look', 'boom', 'tell', 'unfollow', 'tell', 'mean', 'month', 'later', 'boom', 'social', 'medium', 'tell', 'tired', 'lie', 'fight', 'life', 'communication', 'call', 'crazy', 'say', 'love', 'friend', 'right', 'reach', 'tell', 'word', 'feel', 'mention', 'probably', 'number', 'hope', 'say', 'yeah', 'matter', 'point', 'get', 'tired', 'try', 'know', 'anymore', 'want', 'know', 'worry', 'overthinke']"

However, my S.O and I are living in different cities because I am pursuing my master’s degree and he is back in our home town working full time. For the past few months, I’ve made some really good friends. The only problem is that one of my friends is a guy who I had feelings for but I never acted on them because I wanted to work things out with my S.O. My friend has not taken this very well. He doesn’t like talking about relationships or like me talking about mine because he will never be able to be with me and I sense he is jealous . I see him as a good friend but he sees me as something more. 

At this point, I’m not even sure if we have a friendship that is based off of mutual interest in each other. I get the feeling that if he can’t be with me romantically, he doesn’t want me in his life at all. 

I’ve been ignoring him for the past few days because when I tried toto bring up our “friendship” recently he got weird again and ignored me for a while. I’m tired of playing this game. I am waiting for him to reach out to me because I think I’ve done my part. If he does reach out, is it even worth having a conservation about “us”? I’m not even sure we could be just friends....

(F/f, 2 year relationship, both 19)","I’m 19 and so is she, but we’ve been together for 2 years. I left out of town for college and she really struggled with long distance (which I totally understood) and ended up lying to me and her friends about practically everything. She made me think I was crazy while I was right the entire time. Nonetheless, I forgave her because it was a difficult transition and I haven’t always been the best girlfriend to her. 


Fast forward a few months and things were definitely better, she bought me a promise ring and we submitted an application for her to join me at University the following fall. In April, she messaged me and told me we were over because she slept with someone the previous night. She was not at all apologetic and made it known all over social media (before I became blocked) that her new girl was way better than I ever was. Two short weeks after that, her and her girlfriend (18) signed a lease for an apartment together. For their one month anniversary, she proposed and now they are engaged. 


I am having a hard time reading her recently, she’s unblocked my mom and all my friends from her Snapchat story and is posting pictures of her girlfriend with captions from songs we’ve dedicated to each other, even buying her her engagement ring from the same place my promise ring was from. She’s doing cocaine and driving drunk, things she previously looked down on people for. I never want to judge, but her new girlfriend and I are nothing alike, nor is she like any of the other girls my ex has dated. 


For Christmas last year, I bought my ex tickets for a concert that I’ve decided to attend with my friend instead, and my ex bought tickets for her and her new girlfriend for that exact concert. My ex’s family refuses to talk to me, despite how close we were when we were together. 


My ex has a playlist with my name as the title that she updates frequently with love songs. I am having a hard time understanding any of this. We have shared everything together, her and my first car, we graduated together, we were in marching band together, we like and dislike the same food and movies and tv shows and we had such a strong connection. 


Are they really in love? Is she just trying to mess with me? Do relationships like theirs last forever? Are they genuinely in love?

When I(30F) first met D(40M) four years ago, I expected truly nothing of him but we both ended up deeply in love. We had amazing sex, we laughed a lot together but my jealousy issues increased because he was/is so handsome and women even turned to see him go by sometimes.  He also had a lot of limitations for demonstrating his feelings, and this ended up being a problem. We started living together, and arguing. Heoften told me how I should do things around the house, and made me feel bad about stupid stuff. But in the end we both knew we cared about each other, we even talked a lot about marrying and starting a family. In the end of the relationship, we argued more and more and i couldn’t handle him not getting his shit together(he lacked a job and was practically being sustained by his father at almost age 40), and in the end i asked what he felt and he told me he didn’t know if he loved me. I was heartbroken and I left him.

Some months went by and I started dating a friend of a friend, F(32). F was super into me, he admired every aspect of my personality,  we had a lot in common, and could talk about anything and I knew he liked me even though I had some jealous issues I was carrying along. But, the sex was awful, I was super into him, and I felt VERY attracted towards him but I started not wanting to initiate sex. He was kind of selfish in some sexual aspects and lacked empathy to the other, so I told him this, tried to help, was patient but things didn’t change. I got confused about my feelings and in the end we broke up. He resented me, and after a while we became friends again, and I started falling for him. A certain infatuation, because I never got that far into knowing him to really get to the love fase. 

So D appeared, admitting  he had been in love, and wanting to mend things. Changed, working independently in some projects and being super loving towards me. We started seeing each other, and I had these feelings for F. Now I can’t handle my feelings and I certainly don’t know what I want. I cannot separate my feelings (still some love or maybe familiarity with D and infatuation towards F) and they are both currently approaching me romantically. 

I still have a really deep sexual, physical and “comfortable” connection with D, we have amazing sex, I love spending time with him before and after sex, but with F I want to avoid sex, and if something sexual happens I stop feeling comfortable around him.  But I really admire and enjoy every second before sex with him. I even want to make plans with him everyday, while with D I do not feel as compelled as I used to, but when we see each other we have a good time. 
Another thing about D is that I don’t admire him that much intellectually and we have some different views. He doesn’t believe in science, while I am a very rational person. 

I am very confused and cannot seem to decide. And even though I may think I have an unconscious decision, I fear I would choose poorly and end up being hurt or hurting someone, what should I do?

563,8jo2nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jo2nq/worried_about_my_wife_baby_stuff/,Worried about my wife [Baby Stuff],"*Throwaway account, if it isn't obvious. My wife browses reddit extensively and I'll be keeping everything as vague as possible except where necessary \(it may lead to things sounding a bit...cold in their descriptions \(""it"", ""the child"", etc\) but it's purely for as much anonymity as possible\).*

We had a baby 2 years ago. My wife already had anxiety issues before the baby but afterwards it's gotten noticeably worse especially when the baby would cry. Now, I am aware and fully understand that, biologically, women are hard wired to react strongly when a baby cries. What bothers me is that I've never been sure the average extent of the reaction. 

In our case, any time the baby would cry for any reason, cue a near panicked freak out from my wife to get the baby to stop crying. This has carried on into toddlerhood as well and the child has learned that, where mom is concerned, all it has to do is cry even a little and she will scramble to get it quiet.

To say the tantrums are troubling to me is an understatement.

When the child is with me, it behaves quite well for a toddler. Tantrums are few because it knows that I don't fall for its tricks. If mother is even in the house, however, it's like an entirely different child. The child will barely listen to me or her if it knows she's anywhere even in earshot although it's usually slightly better behaved if I'm around than if it's just her and the child.

*I would like to take a moment to state that I'm not some absentee, mother has to do ALL the work father. I took a job where I could work from home as much as possible so that I can help out as much as possible. For various reasons, I took the majority care of the child for the first week and a half when it came home as my wife wasn't able to fully \(physical and post\-partum due to c\-section and other issues that aren't pertinent to this situation\) . If she needs help, I drop what I'm doing and help as best as I can. It can be argued that I have spent almost as much time with the child as she has.* 

When I've brought up my concerns in the past, I get one of two answers \(no matter how carefully or diplomatically I approach the subject\):

1. ""Women are wired differently and we HAVE to stop their crying as quickly as possible etc etc""
2. ""Don't you dare criticize my parenting! How about YOU take care of it full time and I'll go back to work!?""

Even though I've demonstrated that it's faking the crying and how to spot it AND she admits that it's faking the crying a lot of times now, she still refuses to try and correct the behavior because of ""the wires"". Problem is, she's having more and more meltdowns as the child is getting worse and worse. She taking out her frustrations on me and those around her. 

I'm honestly at my own wit's end because I'm worried about her and the baby. I step in when I hear her getting frustrated but I'm actually scared of her snapping one day when I'm out at a meeting or running and errand or something. I know from my own experience with the child that once it sees the tantrums don't work any more, they'll stop very fast. She can't leave it alone, though ""I can't ignore it! It's thrashing around on the floor and it'll hit its head"" or ""It's been crying for 2 minutes straight. It's not going to stop unless I give it what it wants!""

564,8jnzxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jnzxb/is_my_24f_boyfriend_23m_gay/,Is my (24F) boyfriend (23M) gay???,"I'm really not homophobic, transphobic or any kind of phobic. I'm a really accepting person I swear!! This is just something that has always been on my mind and I've never felt comfortable asking anybody I know about it because of the affect it could have!

To get right to it - My boyfriend has never expressed any kind of attraction for men that I have noticed, except for the occasional acknowledging a guy or celebrity is attractive when we are discussing it, which is totally normal. 

But he does act what I guess I could call feminine? And does little things that are STEREOTYPICALLY gay (I am not saying all gay people act this way. But when you think of stereotypes you know what I'm trying to say). For example, I've always noticed that his voice inflections are somewhat feminine and he even has a slight lisp. This was extremely apparent to me when we first met (a mutual friend introduced us at a party) and I immediately wondered if he was gay. (Again, I know it's not cool to stereotype people). None of his friends have ever mentioned anything about him being anything other than straight but why would they, right? They're not my close friends they're his but we all get along. He also uses a lot of feminine and excessive hand gestures (think stereotypical). When he is trying to recount what a female said to him he puts on this (what I would call) ""gay voice"" and I know that he's trying to act like a girl but he's just a little to good at doing that voice? But I should know that a ""gay voice"" doesn't = a gay dude

Not to mention, almost all of his friends are either gay or girls. He has a few straight guy friends but they're not really close. His best best friends are all gay. All of his girl friends treat him like a gay best friend and tell him all their problems. He seems more like one of the girls. Hes even called me ""girl"" like he was a girl talking to his bff.  Idk. He's never been with any girl before me. When I'm being paranoid I start thinking am I the only girl who is stupid enough to date someone clearly not straight?

I really don't know if I'm being harsh or judgmental or what but when I notice these things I can't help but feel weird. How do I work through these feelings? I don't feel like I could ask him because I know it would make him really upset. He gets extremely defensive about almost everything lol. I can't ask my friends because I don't want them to start thinking he's gay if he's not. 

And maybe he's not gay he's just feminine! But am I in the wrong if it makes me uncomfortable? I love him to death because he's really in tune with his emotions. But there are times when I feel like I really want that manly man and that's not really him at all. 

Any advice please!!!! And don't bash me for being homophobic because I am not. I'm not sure why I have these feelings and I want to be able to learn from this.

We met when she moved over because she was my neighbor for duration of her exchange. Fast forward a bit and we end up dating. Out of any girl I ever dated she was the one I was most compatible with, we had an insane amount of things in common and \(from what I thought\) we couldn't get enough of each other's company. 

The four months went by flying and she had to move back to Toronto. Before she left we decided to keep in touch with each other by adding each other on our social media accounts. Two weeks after she left we talked almost every day. I had been planning on getting a job this Summer from June to August to save up some money to visit her sometime next semester so we could see each other again. I decided to tell her and the response I got from her is that she felt uncomfortable with me spending my time and money to come see her because she's unsure if she'll have time and this being her last year before her masters, she is also unsure about her future and where she'll end up studying. She says she hopes she gets a place at my university but would apply some other places.  She said she didn't want to hurt me or lose me since she still wanted to visit me and travel around Europe with me.

At this point for some reason I just started feeling a bit disdain for her. During her last week here I opened up and dedicated my entire schedule to being with her even though I had a huge exam a week after she left. And the fact that out of the entire semester she couldn't free up just one week to be with me really kinda pissed me off and made me think she probably doesn't like me the same way I like her. I really do like her a lot and don't want these negative emotions towards her but it really does frustrate me that I freed up my time for her during a busy week but she can't open up anywhere in her semester for me yet she still says she wants to visit me later. She kept telling me she hopes to get a place at my university and that she can't wait to see me again but then feels uncomfortable if I decide to visit her.

What do I do? Should I just forget her and stop talking to her?

* Who came up with moving together? Did you search for a apartment, did you decide to move in with your so or vice versa (or getting married).

We wanted a family right away and started trying almost immediately after getting married. I just had my third miscarriage. It's done a number on my confidence and my mental health. I've spent 26 of the last 52 weeks pregnant, and my body looks worse than before and I have no baby to show for it. Before we try again, I want to make sure I'm in a good place mentally. I was doing really good, until my husband tagged me in something on reddit. He knows my regular username and I know his. We generally get along really well and can talk through anything. We've weathered some really difficult things during our relationship.

I accidentally ended up on his posts in order to see the parent comment of the thing he tagged me in. When you go to a profile on mobile, it shows communities the person is most active in. His top is Gentlemen Boners. He also apparently has an alternate account he uses to communicate with his normal account. There were comments on some of the gone wild subs. He's kind of nasty and rude online-- (like making fun of disabled people)not someone I would want to be with. I don't care if he looks at porn or other women, but actively commenting on other women's appearances and porn bothers me, especially because my own self confidence is pretty low right now. One of my greatest fears that I've tried communicating is that I fear he resents me because I may not be able to have children, which is something he really wants. The comments were during a sexual dry spell when I would initiate and he wouldn't respond. 

I don't want to approach him and accuse him of anything. We're usually really open, so him hiding stuff worries me. I'm not sure whether this is something I should broach with him or not, but I do feel like it's impacting our relationship.

My girlfriend (26 F) and I (25 M) have been dating over two years from a short distance to a long distance. She came to America to work a little bit and unfortunately had to go back to South Korea. We are both South Koreans. We spent about 1 year together in America and 1 year over the phone as she left after a year. As much as we had a true and faithful relationship, we decided to get married in the future. Speaking of reality, I told her to come to America. (If you know or not, South Korea is notorious about their employment, in terms of compensation, workload, stress, forcefully drinking (a culture thing).) 
For myself, I already had a stable job as an electrical engineer working in a good environment. My girlfriend got a job as a teacher/care taker in this huge kindergarten facility (over 300 kids) in Korea.
“Doing the math”, I really believe that we can have a better life and chance in America.
Here are the problems/issues I have.

•	Her father does not know my existence. Her mother knows. My parents met my gf. I asked her if she could tell him about me that this marriage can be expected to happen. Even we promised each other to get married, she is afraid to tell her father that he might not let her come to America. We are both only child.  I can understand how her father could not let her go. But seriously? 

•	Of course, because of 14 hours of time difference, we always talk night or morning. That is not the issue. The issue is that she comes back home after 9 P.M almost every day. What I wanted was a text after her work that she got home safely; there are times she did not as she was too tired to do so. In addition, she is having such a hard time at work… I told her why not quit and come to America that I can support her and all. 

Right now, our plan is for me to wait and go to South Korea in about 6 months to meet and talk to her parents. Possibly (and probably), end up waiting for her again after that. 

To be honest, I am a normal human being too. I get lonely and sometimes the situation drives me crazy with a fact that I cannot even go on a date (as in going out to movies or dinner with my gf), and just had to suck up to be a third-wheel with a couple (friends). As a person with a history of severe depressions, it was hurting too much to see other couples outside. Thus, I try to shun social life, forcing myself to stay home, play videos games, etc. 

It is hard to describe everything in details but above is a general idea.
To those who might judge me, I am faithful and very meticulous about many things. I do get worried easily that came to my obsession of her. As well as she does to me. 
I love her and she loves me. But I have my doubts sometimes (delusional of me).

I want to ask for advices what I should do. I want to wait but I am scared she might leave me after me waiting.

So i'm [20/m] contemplating breaking up with my girlfriend [20/f] after being together for three years. We started out quite happy and to be honest if you asked her she would probably say things are fine. Sure enough we have been though fights and all the usual things couples go through but I am just scared I have jumped in head first into something I cannot commit to yet. I feel like I have grown apart from her and am more distant than ever. I am starting to see her as a friend not a partner.

I guess this all started about a year ago and I have been mostly keeping it in only lightly dropping the topic into general chat. Should I break up with her? We can always start things up again if we end up drawing eachother back in years to come. Furthermore I wouldn't want to end on a bad note but I am unsure how she will take this she leans on me A LOT! But friends can lean on eachother right?

Whats the first step towards repairing our relationship?,"So extremely long story short, I found out that my boyfriend of half a decade was talking to a friend, complaining about me, and ended up saying some things that honestly hurt a lot. A lot of negative talk about things that I had previously confided in him that I was sensitive about, ways that I worried about the future and things that I know are flaws that I'm trying to recitfy. 

The crappy part is he's always been my biggest supporter and fan, he's always relentlessly supported me, so the things he said we're even more hurtful because it feels like they invalidated all the good aspects of our relationship. It's hard to reconcile the person who said these awful things with the person who's been my rock for so long, the only person I've been able to tell everything to.

I really want to get over this hurt and move on in our relationship, and as far as on his side, he's deeply deeply apologetic. He said he didn't mean the things he said, he was just upset, and that it took writing all those things out (and sending it to his friend) for him to realize how messed up he was being. It's just really difficult for me to accept this and move on. I feel genuinely heartbroken, and I feel like I don't truly know my boyfriend. 

Help?

He is honestly the best thing to ever happen to me which is why this situation sucks so much. 

The relationship came rather soon after a much needed break up with my previous boyfriend. This guy was the complete opposite ... he cheated on me with his ex and other girls. I never fully knew the entire situation as quite frankly, I didn't want to put myself through the agony of feeling so unworthy. I spent 6 agonizing months with a guy who convinced me (and himself) that he loved me, and that he would change etc (I won't bore you, you know the type of guy). And for a while it worked, and to my knowledge he did stop cheating, but I just fell out of love with him from all the hurt he caused. The one thing I have always struggled to get over was how well he convinced me he loved me, and also how well he hid the cheating at first. The news of him cheating came from a mutual person (friend is a strong word) and it hit me like a ton of bricks.

Anyway, fast forward to this new guy - he is absolutely perfect, I was unbelievably cautious at first, but I realized that no amount of defenses would change how much I liked him. He is so against cheating, only had a few girlfriends, has a small group of friends of whom I have got to know well, his family are amazingly kind and have just made me one of them. He isn't at all shy about me being on his phone playing games or scrolling through websites if mines dead, one day my laptop died and he immediately sent me his password without asking when he was out. Basically everything you can think of screams family man, 100% trustworthy and I know that he is.  

So why do I sometimes get this feeling of jealousy like hes hiding something? And how do I stop it? I'm fed up of feeling this way, I just want those feelings to completely go as I know they're completely out of place. I would hate myself if I ruined this relationship due to jealousy, he knew my ex and witnessed what he put me through, but I don't want to treat him like my ex at all because hes not.

Any advice on how to stop feeling this way would be amazing :)

574,8jnllt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jnllt/it_hit_the_fan_this_time/,It hit the fan this time,"WARNING: long multifaceted post to follow.  Throw away for obvious reasons. 

My wife (30F) and I (32M) recently spent the day outdoors at a local area in which a lot of people get together and hang out. Drinking was very much involved. We are regulars at this location and as such have a particular crowd that we hang out with when we go. One of the older couples are local business owners and brought one of their newer employees. Needless to say this guy and I have a history. During my high school years this guy made my life a living hell. I was relatively small in those days and he was an early bloomer. Picture a 15 year old kid that stands 6’2” 210lbs, while I was a mere 5’5” 135lbs. Anyway, during this time this guy took it upon himself to beat the ever loving shit out of me. This wasn’t your typical school yard fight. This guy would come from behind while I was unaware, choke me unconscious, and proceed to beat the back of my head while I was defenseless on the ground. This happened twice. Both times resulted in minor concussions, contusions, abrasions, and your standard humiliation. For the next two and a half years he mercilessly harassed me until he finally dropped out of school. Fast forward to the day in reference. His boss and my friend becomes aware of the situation and proceeds to goad me into talking to him. I decline. I explain that I’m not harboring any grudge at this point, but just would prefer to keep my distance. Somehow my wife chimes in and does the same. Again, I explain that I would prefer to mind my own business and enjoy my day. I also pull my wife aside to say in a summarized fashion what happened and why I feel that way. She continues and so does the friend. For HOURS. My day is dampered, but not ruined so I shrug it off and we go home. 

Here’s where the shit hits the fan. 

Once home I ask my wife that in the event that something like that ever comes up again to please respect my judgement and let it go. She protests. I get aggravated and say “I wish someone would have beat the fuck out of you when you were younger and see how you would have responded.” SHE PUNCHES ME SQUARE IN THE FACE. Out of pure adrenaline and reflex I slap her in her face. She then screams that she is calling the cops and is leaving with our young child. She’s drunk and there’s no way I’m letting her leave with our kid. I pin her down because she won’t take no for an answer. She continues hitting me and kicking me. Eventually I push her hands back and in the process my elbow hits her nose causing it to bleed. She wants to press charges. I call my parents, and they come defuse the situation. She corroborates all of this to them while I’m in another room. We go to sleep and I try to bring it up the next day. According to her, she’s the victim in all of this. I’m not saying that me slapping her was right. It wasn’t and I felt/feel terrible about it, but she instigated violence. I’m really not sure what to do at this point. We went from a pretty simple argument about respect to full blown domestic violence. Now that I’ve had some time to reflect, I’ve also come to the conclusion that had I punched her and the shoe was on the other foot she would be filing divorce and I would be in a jail cell. I’m not really sure where to go from here. 

Edit: this is the first instance of any violence in our relationship. Before this, we’ve had ups and downs, but for the most part a good marriage.

576,8jnfrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jnfrt/i_feel_like_my_parents_dont_care_about_me/,I feel like my parents don’t care about me...,"I don’t even know where to start this. I’m 19 years old and I haven’t always had the greatest relationship with my parents. My mother (38F) was a drug addict and was in and out of my life until I was 13 years old. Once she got sober, we started going to therapy together and it somewhat repaired our relationship. I was always hurt and didn’t know why my mom wasn’t around (my father never told me about her addiction). Well fast forward to now, my mother is in an abusive relationship with a woman who hates me and doesn’t want her around me. I rarely see my mother and when I do it’s like pulling teeth since her girlfriend will cut contact with her for days, or weeks, for speaking to me. So. I try to stay away from her as often as I can for her convenience. I didn’t even get to see my mom on Mother’s Day, which hurt, but I survived. 

Now my dad  (40M) is just a total dick. I don’t even know what to say. We were really close when I was a child but since I’ve turned 18 he has expected me to be entirely independent and not come to him for anything. I don’t live with either of my parents and I pay my own bills. The only thing I’ve ever asked my father for help for (and he agreed to help me) was giving me a ride home from work because I get off work late at night and can not afford a car right now. 

So about two weeks ago, my boyfriend got a car from his parents as a graduation gift. Obviously I’m really happy for my boyfriend. My dad had other plans... he pretty much told me he wasn’t going to pick me up from work anymore, since my boyfriend has a car, it’s now HIS responsibility to pick me up everyday and help me with anything else I might need help with. He said “you are his responsibility now, not mine”. This was hurtful to hear, as it seemed like my dad was throwing me at somebody else without even talking to them about it first. My boyfriend is really upset because he doesn’t have a job and can not afford to pick me up everyday since gas prices are so expensive now, so I’m putting in gas money and filling up his tank since I feel like I have to. 

Another thing I’d like to add: I have my medical marijuana card. I’ve had it for two years now. My father knew this and took advantage multiple times by having me go out of my way to buy him weed. I would have to schedule my life to accommodate him so I could order weed for him at specific times which was super annoying but I did it anyway. After almost a year I got fed up and told him he needed to find his own way because it wasn’t convenient at all for me. He got really pissy and got his own card and now he doesn’t really communicate with me at all.

I’m feeling really hurt. Between my mother hardly speaking to me because her girlfriend hates me, and my dad taking my kindness for weakness and throwing me into the arms of someone else without even consulting them first, I don’t know what to think. My parents never check up on me or ask me how I’m doing. All my father does is take and never offers to give... I really feel like my parents don’t care about me. I feel fucking alone almost all of the time and I have so many issues because of the relationship I have with both of my parents. The only time I ever had their undivided attention was after a suicide attempt (go figure)

She’s clinically depressed, so she gets sad and lonely very easily, which I am aware of and cautious of, so I try to make her feel included as much as I can.  However, lately, I’ve been going out to meet friends a lot, especially those who I haven’t seen in ages or those that I won’t see in a while now that they’re graduating, and because she just moved to the city, she doesn’t really have anyone else to go out with, so she’s been telling me I’ve been bitchy by not inviting her out to my plans as well, and how she’s been crying all night because of her feelings of not being included.  I don’t know how to handle this situation because I can’t invite her out to meetings with my friends, especially since most of the time, I’m meeting friends one on one to catch up, and she would just be awkward sitting there between us since we don’t have any mutual friends.  If I were going out to parties or something, I would definitely extend an invitation to her, but I’m not, so how do I handle this situation because I feel like I definitely need to have a face to face discussion with her about this later tonight once I get home from work.  Have I actually been a bitch by stepping all over her?

tl;dr my flatmate has clincal depression and has been blaming me for her depressive episodes lately because I haven't been inviting her out to my meetings with friends.  So I don't know how to resolve this argument between her and I.

Edit: I'm trying to get her to talk to me about this face to face, but she seems to be avoiding it, as she's been texting me about it all day, and these kinds of things need to be discussed in person, so I think she's afraid of confrontation.  I want to do it in a neutral environment (the kitchen/living room), but she doesn't seem to want to come out of her room and I tried suggesting meeting up tomorrow after work at a cafe.

my best friend and a fella I was seeing for months have been spending a lot of time together talking about me behind my back and both swearing there's nothing going on even though he sent me a message meant for her about me and how I suspect something so I know they've been together but they're still lying to me telling me it's all in my head and are happy to leave me feeling like I'm going crazy which sometimes I feel I am. Since this started she's been telling him lies about things I've said about him and he believes everything she says even though I've begged and pleaded with him to stop fighting with me me and believing her (they hardly know each other and yet he believes her word over mine every time) and since I blocked both of them now she's going to my friends causing trouble for me with them, this was my best friend we talked everyday and knew everything about each other but she's betrayed that for a man she hardly knew and now she's trying and succeeding to ruin my life and I don't understands why, I know I need to forget about them and get over it but I just can't get over the hurt I wake up every morning and the hurt hits me like a brick to the stomach. I'm already struggling with depression and getting help for that, which she obviously knows about, but this is pushing me closer and closer to the edge, the day after he sent me the message meant for her it kicked up so much fighting and drama that i did nothing to deserve I didn't understand and I couldn't cope with (I had to plead with him to stop fighting with me and believing her but still it went on) I end up needing suicide intervention. I feel utterly heartbroken by her not him and I can't understand or figure out why someone I loved and trusted with my life could turn on me so heartlessly, please help me figure out a way to get over this pain!

Regret?","Boyfriend (30) Me- F (25). We moved together after only 5 months of long distance relationship together after meeting one another on a vacation of mine. He immediately for me instantly which was kind of alarming, he seemed so charming, like a prince, always had manners and was extremely sauve. But I ignored the redflag even after coming from a relationship that lasted for 4 years with a guy who was just like that but turned out to be the worst nightmare ever.

We moved in together with an apartment that he shared with his pregnant little sister for the time being. He is Cuban, I am Black-American. He moved to the states about 2 years ago. To me he views and judges Americans so harshly and if anyone thinks differently than him or does things different from him he sees them as ""not doing things right in life"". So I have been under his scrunity for the past 3 weeks since I've moved basically walking on eggshells. Somedays he is affectionate towards me, somedays he completely ignores me and I have not once felt included in his life, he will leave the house without saying goodbye or tell me where he is going or anything, he'll just walk right past me. I am expected to do things perfectly and take word on his advice. I don't feel welcome or wanted at all. He told me if wants a woman that will help him get ahead in life, to support him in his goals and dreams and ""do the right thing"" in life. It just sounds like business to me, he doesnt mention passion, love, trust or anything. And I don't feel that with him. He is the only person I know here and I am starting to feel homesick and also running low on cash as I still have not found a proper job yet. Depression is starting to kick in, I just feel like a useless dummy to him, he plays on my heart and feelings. One day he is hot, the next his is cold. It depends on if I have ""done things right"" to him, if not he will punish me with the silent treatment. I try to be considerate, helpful, loving and patient as I can but I'm crumbling :( He isn't empathetic either. I just withdrawl myself now.

tr;dl: Moved from hometown to be with boyfriend only to find out I don't think he's really into me and is not what he portrayed. I am also homesick, so relationship trouble only intensifys this feeling as I do not feel welcomed or comfortable by boyfriend.

They pretty much treat me the same as a guy, and honestly I'd feel weird if any of them thought of me like that. 

Me and a few of them were hanging out, we started to have a few beers. Now one of them, let's call him Steve, gets really competitive when he's drunk. I went to lift something and he starts making comments about my muscles. I can't remember exactly what I said but we ended up wrestling, you know, like typical drunk college kids. Now some of these guys have known me before they would've even seen girls that way so this is kinda just typical Steve. 

I get him on his back and I realise something. He's got a boner, and I can feel something near his pants. My first thought is he spilled his beer, but I had had a few beers and I was sure it was cum. And the strange thing is I was kinda turned on. I get off him and it gets kind of quiet so I just got up and left. I'm thinking about this way too much but I'm just weirded out at the idea of being into him.

There's a girl that we were both previously friends with that won't leave him alone in my opinion. She constantly texts him and brings him gifts and wants to hang out with him. 

This girl has always been very manipulative. She's one of those people that uses her mental illness as an excuse to make people do anything she wants for her (I have a few mental illnesses too-I'm not bashing that I just don't believe they should be used as a manipulation tactic) she isn't too great to the people around her. She's cheated on her boyfriend several times among a bunch of other things I won't get into.

Anyways, I've really tried to get along with this girl but she isn't nice to me at all. She refuses to talk to me, spreads a bunch of fake rumors about me to people I know, and I've lost a few friends because of this. I have tried to take the high road and not do the same. She's accused me of taking her best friend from her, and that's something I'd never do.

My boyfriend knows that I don't like this girl and she makes me uncomfortable. I recently found out he told her a while back that she should stay away when I'm around because I DON'T LIKE HER and he didn't want to upset me, so this would explain the stuff she was doing I guess.

He told me that I was more important to him than she was and that he was really annoyed with her and just wanted her to leave him alone because he didn't like her anymore.

Fast-forward to last week: I find out he's been hanging out with this girl and hiding it from me.   I get upset and decide that we need a break from each other until we calm down from this. I talked to the girl and told her the truth about how he'd lied to both of us trying to clear things up and hoping we could get along. She told me what a terrible person I was and how nothing could ever be his fault.

I think we've all three screwed up along the line somewhere but he doesn't seem to care that I'm upset. I don't think he gets that it hurts me when they're together. I'm all for him choosing his own friends but I think if they don't treat me with even a little bit of respect that he should be upset and not want to hang out with her.

I may not have a specific question here but I'm wondering how do you think I should handle this situation? I'll provide more details if you want, couldn't fit them all here and I'm sure I left out something important.

Thanks all!

In some he seems almost desperate asking if they remember him and trying to keep the conversation going. He says he just wanted to catch up. That’s fine but I’m just curious why are they just women.

What worries me the most is that recently I found out he was part of this singles group on meetup and I asked him why and he said it was for his brother who’s single. I told him why when he knows his brother doesn’t like meet ups. He said he was trying to convince him.

But unfortunately last december, after 4 years of being together, something completely crashed, she told me she needs a break, because she doesn't ""feel"" it, etc. We've had a big talk, in which she told me that I am still her best friend, that she really cares about me and that she wants to spend time with me, hopefully to learn to love me again like she once did.  

I was devastated honestly, but quickly accepted the situation, trying to make the best out of it. I was really trying hard, for the first weeks it was really fine, hanging out together, actually I couldn't even tell something has changed. Then we've went on a trip together we've had booked for some time, and I spent a whole week with her. And then I saw that she spends literally 24/7 chatting with her new friends from a discord group. I've talked with her about it, because it wasn't really fun being ""alone"" on a trip. She told that she's made new friends and I shouldnt be bothered etc. After we've camed back I told her that I didn't like the fact that she was ignoring me and decided to step back a bit.   

Next month I've watched her losing every interest of spending time with me and having her new online friends take the place, then she apparently find a love in one guy from that group, I was really sad, but I couldn't do much so I just decided to live my own life. But then she started to text me again, but for a week the only thing we've talked about was her new boyfriend, her plans to meet him etc. and I could tell she knows I still had feeling for her. After they finally met and she showed me a photo of them kissing I decided to block her because I just couldn't stop thinking about this and it started to destroy me.   

A month later and I'm pretty fine, still sad about losing my best friend. Yesterday after month of not contacting each other and not knowing anything what's going on in her life she texted me ""Hey, why did you block me on fb?"". And that was all. Now my question is, do I tell her the truth and say that she hurt me etc. or do I make something up or do i stay silent? I really miss her being my friend since she was a really cool person to hang with, we've had many hobbies shared together.  I have no idea what to do, she seems so distant now.   

Forgive my english

We did the whole military thing and got married quickly, then we bought a house together because we're both stationed at the same base and have a dog and the cost of rent is crazy. We both decided that even though everything happened quickly we wouldn't actually go through with the marriage unless we loved each other so we went through with our marriage and BOUGHT our house. Everything \(I thought\) was amazing. I've never been more happy in my life. Then he went on a TDY to California for 45 days, everything was great, we still texted all day and facetimed before bed every night. We never have any arguments and maybe like 2 miniscule disagreements that we've worked through, nothing crazy at all. We get along well, have \(well had\) a great sex life, and the night he came home the first thing he says is that he wants a divorce. Of course, I'm devastated. It's been 3 weeks now and he agreed to go to counseling with me, we've gone once and it was good but he said he's only 50&#37; in our relationship. When asked why \(by me, the first 2 weeks\) he couldn't give me answers or any reasons at all besides he's ""not happy"" and got some ""clarity in california"". After talking witht the counselor he explained more that he doesn't feel happy with himself and he doesn't love himself so he can't give me the love that I deserve. He says he knows that I love him and that he loves me too but he doesn't feel like it's fair to me for him to ""drag it on"" when he doesn't know if/what his purpose is in life and he doesn't know if this is ultimately what he wants anymore. He said that we couldn't be roommates \- but he hasn't moved out any of his things and we still sleep in the same bed. We've had sex 3 times since he's been home but 2 of the times was him just like waking me up in the middle of the night and then us having sex. For the first two weeks he was back he wouldnt hold my hand or kiss me or touch me. Since counsling he at least will kiss me goodbye as we leave for work and usally before we go to sleep. He won't go out to dinner with me \(but this was our ""homework"" for this week from the counselor and it's only Tuesday so maybe something will happen\). I just don't know what to do. of course my friends are telling me to let it go and leave him and be happy but I never would have married someone that I didn't see a future with. Just 2 months ago I was late on my period and we talked about having a child together \(although we both don't feel 100&#37; ready and we are not pregnant, thankfully \*not trying to offend anyone\) We are 23 and 22, have careers in the military, own our home, only really have our car payments as our bills \(and little stuff like phone/insurance and what goes with the house\) so we have a bright future. And he says it isn't me or anything really wrong in our relationship just that he isn't happy and I dn't deserve to be drug along. But I have told him I want to be by his side and support him as much as possible while he works through his issues and figures things out. That I meant our vows ""for better or for worse"" and that I want this marriage to work. We are still going to go to counseling together and he said he will also go to counseling for himself, so that's good. But I don't know what else to do?! I've tried everything, I even went to Catholic Mass with him this Sunday \(I'm not Catholic\) so we can get into the habit of going to Church together. But I don't know what to do/think. He hasn't mentioned that he wants a divorce since that night. I even asked him just to sleep in the guest room but he won't, and he does still hold me at night \(at least this last week he has\). I feel hurt and heartbroken but also hopeful, and maybe it's just wishful thinking. Any advice/input/other questions are appreciated.

588,8jmhpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jmhpe/wife_wants_to_sleep_with_other_people/,Wife wants to sleep with other people.,"We've been married for about 9 months, together for a almost two years before that and have a one year old girl.

My wife who I love took a three day vacation to Florida to meet with a guy after her birthday. She wanted to figure things, be young, see what she wanted. She didn't sleep with him, they did kiss once. I let her go because I didn't want her to resent me and I want her to be happy, and want to be with me.

We've talked a little about since she got back it's been interesting. We're doing better, I'm trying harder. But last night she opened up to me about what's been on her mind and how she feels.

She feels that she never had time to be young, let loose, experience, experiment, sleep around party whatever. She went from high school and living with her parents to being with me.

She feels she needs to go out and get it out of her system. But she does feel like she might be a sex addict. Which I can see, and the way she talks about everything she sounds like one. As I am a former drug addict I can see the resemblance in thoughts and behavior.

She does love me and doesn't want to hurt me she doesn't want to divorce but she also feels like that's what might need to happen. She doesn't know what to do.

I can write more and I plan on it, or maybe I'll make an update lost when I'm at home and on my computer, as I'm writing on mobile. Thanks for any responses and I will respond to all questions on my breaks.



EDIT:
She hates that she feels this way. She wants to be with me. Marriage is hard and it takes work. It was a mistake to get married we've talked about that, we weren't ready and we had the baby before we were married. Open relationship is not an option, I couldn't handle that. It's either me or divorce. She knows that.

I let her go, because I didn't want her to resent me making her stay. She regrets leaving and she did not fuck him. We're very honest with each other and she also found out the guy is autistic.

590,8jmcua,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jmcua/i_20m_am_confused_about_getting_back_with/,"I [20M] am confused about getting back with ""technically cheating"" ex [20F]","Hi lovely community! I'm looking for some advice here, first, the context, i'll try to be as brief as possible.

I had a kinda normal relationship with this human, lasted over 6 months. She applied to be an exchange student while we were a couple, and she changed when she got accepted. We dated less, she started having less time and showing little to no interest. I found her using excuses to not go out with me, we had multiple conversations and I honestly told her it was fine if she didn't feel comfortable with me and that we could break up, but she didn't want to. She became more distant, we barely dated \(1\-2 times per month\) and since she didn't have time I decided to break up.

We kept seeing each other after breaking up and weirdly we somehow dated more than when we were a couple. Since she was leaving for the exchange program I decided to spend what little time I had left with her, enjoying ourselves together, despite not being a couple but basically doing what a couple does.

When she left we agreed to not have ties to eachother, I didn't say I was going to wait for her the whole year the program lasted, neither she said something like that. She wanted to promise ""honesty and communication"", we liked and felt love for the other at the moment, so I accepted that and we both promised to tell the other if something happened, if feelings stopped, if someone else appeared, she left that day.

4 months later I found out she kissed someone and that she hide it from me for over a month. Over that month she told me how much she missed me, all that kind of things. I talked with her about that, saying that I found out. First she denied it and lied about it, then accepted it very angry. She tried to explain but I didn't wanted any explaining, I just told her I found out and asked her to stop talking to me, said I didn't want dishonest people in my life, she got angry and hung up.

After almost 2 years she talked with me and explained what happened, she was mild drunk and feeling alone. They started a relationship that didn't worked out because she never felt love for that person. She apologized, telling me how much she regrets doing that, wishing things were different. She confessed still feeling something for me and wishing we were together ""if only things were different"".

I resisted the desire to talk to her after the phone call. I honestly wanted to see her and know about her. I really loved this human, but I knew that resisting and being distant was ""the right thing"". I still like her and I don't know why if I did all the correct things to move on. If the ""kinda cheating"" thing didn't exist I would be trying to get back together. My heart says ""go with her, forget everything and start to love again"", my brain says ""you already were a doormat, you're no plan B, love yourself, stay away"".

I don't know what to do, and this is eating my brain more than it should. What do you recommend?

**TL;DR**

Ex\-gf went to an exchange program, promised communication and honesty, kissed another dude, didn't say a word. I found out and denies it, later accepts it and gets angry. Years later she regrets it and wants to get back, or at least, have some friendship. I want to get back together but my brain tells me not to because it feels betrayed, lied to and treated like a doormat. I'm confused.

Thanks!","['20_m', 'confused', 'get', 'technically', 'cheat', 'ex', '20_f', 'hi', 'lovely', 'community', 'look', 'advice', 'context', 'try', 'brief', 'possible', 'kinda', 'normal', 'relationship', 'human', 'last', '6', 'month', 'apply', 'exchange', 'student', 'couple', 'change', 'get', 'accept', 'date', 'start', 'have', 'time', 'show', 'little', 'interest', 'find', 'excuse', 'multiple', 'conversation', 'honestly', 'tell', 'fine', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'break', 'want', 'distant', 'barely', 'date', '1', '-2', 'time', 'month', 'time', 'decide', 'break', 'keep', 'see', 'break', 'weirdly', 'date', 'couple', 'leave', 'exchange', 'program', 'decide', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'leave', 'enjoy', 'despite', 'couple', 'basically', 'couple', 'leave', 'agree', 'tie', 'eachother', 'go', 'wait', 'year', 'program', 'last', 'say', 'like', 'want', 'promise', 'honesty', 'communication', 'like', 'feel', 'love', 'moment', 'accept', 'promise', 'tell', 'happen', 'feeling', 'stop', 'appear', 'leave', 'day', '4', 'month', 'later', 'find', 'kiss', 'hide', 'month', 'month', 'tell', 'miss', 'kind', 'thing', 'talk', 'say', 'find', 'deny', 'lie', 'accept', 'angry', 'try', 'explain', 'want', 'explain', 'tell', 'find', 'ask', 'stop', 'talk', 'say', 'want', 'dishonest', 'people', 'life', 'get', 'angry', 'hang', '2', 'year', 'talk', 'explain', 'happen', 'mild', 'drunk', 'feel', 'start', 'relationship', 'work', 'feel', 'love', 'person', 'apologize', 'tell', 'regret', 'wish', 'thing', 'different', 'confess', 'feel', 'wish', 'thing', 'different', 'resist', 'desire', 'talk', 'phone', 'honestly', 'want', 'know', 'love', 'human', 'know', 'resist', 'distant', 'right', 'thing', 'like', 'know', 'correct', 'thing', 'kinda', 'cheat', 'thing', 'exist', 'try', 'heart', 'say', 'forget', 'start', 'love', 'brain', 'say', 'doormat', 'plan', 'b', 'love', 'stay', 'away', 'know', 'eat', 'brain', 'recommend', 'tl;dr', 'ex', '-gf', 'go', 'exchange', 'program', 'promise', 'communication', 'honesty', 'kiss', 'dude', 'word', 'find', 'deny', 'later', 'accept', 'get', 'angry', 'year', 'later', 'regret', 'want', 'friendship', 'want', 'brain', 'tell', 'feel', 'betray', 'lie', 'treat', 'like', 'doormat', 'confused', 'thank']"

So I [16/M] have been seing this girl [15/F] for a week now (we have been going on and off a couple of times because of personal problems) and I really like her.

I decided today to call her to see if she wanted to hang out and she said yes (summary of the conversation). I thought that we would hang out with a couple of friends aswell (we are in the same group of friends, me and her) and not just us two. It turns out that my friends are busy and now I'll have to go out with her alone.

This probably doesn't sound as a problem for you people that are a bit older than me but to me it is. I am now nervous and I don't know what to do. Of course I will see her today but I'll need stuff to talk about. I'm not used to talk to girls and I really don't want it to be awkward. What should I say when I meet her for example? Should we hold hands or should I have my arm around her? If so, when?

We got along right off the bat. I mean it was a whirlwind friendship. All the same interests, similar sense of humor, etc. We became very close very quickly. Things were fantastic for years. 

In the later part of high school, there were a couple of incidents where her adult relative sexually assaulted me as a minor. To preempt any suspicion, I was simply grabbing a drink of water when he took it upon himself to grab me. It was not something that I wanted. It happened twice. She was witness to one of those occasions. 

When I broached the topic with A, and my intent to go to the police, she explicitly told me not to, and that it was ""none of my business"" and she would ""take care of it."" I didn't want to intrude so I obliged. Stupid move. Anyway, at the time I was feeling particularly shitty and weird. I was friends with a girl, B, in one of my classes in high school. For some reason, I got it in my head to entertain A, by telling her that B was talking badly about her. The catch is, I was sending B a lot of text messages calling A a lot of mean stuff. This would have happened in like 2012. I have zero recollection of anything I said in those messages, as they were just the means to an end. Goal: make B say mean things about A. Idk either homie, it was stupid high school bullshit. 

So... whatever... nothing extraordinary happens and I am still friends with A. She's really more like a sister to me than anything. Whatever. Anyway. In summer of 2016 A makes a friend, C. They instantly hit it off and start spending a lot of time together. For my part, I am happy to see that A has another close lady friend. C happens to be friends with B. People talk, things happen, and A gets a lot of fun screenshots of me saying terrible mean shit about her. Again, I have no idea what I said. Yikes. 

Well in January 2017, after ignoring me for a couple days, A sends me this obscenely long message calling me ""evil"" and going on and on about how I'm a bad person. It was really upsetting to read, honestly, and I immediately reacted by deleting every single message over the past like 8 years, blocking her on social media, and effectively shutting down emotionally. I only responded once, to a message from C. I spilled the beans about the sexual misconduct (making C the only person to know aside from me and A), and C has the gall to tell me ""A says she would have supported you if you went to the police."" Okay, maybe years later she's saying that, but that's not what she did at the time! She got mad at me for even bringing it up. I dropped the subject completely. 

Anyway. I still feel my behavior in those mean text messages to B was completely uncool. Having A not be a part of my life is a very acute pain. I want to apologize. With all the info in place, and now that some time has passed, what should I do? Thank you for reading. 

Update: Exactly a week after I made this post I got the nerve to message her and she didn't tell me to fuck off so it's going well. She agreed to meet and talk.","['23', 'f', 'reconcile', 'ex', 'friend', '23', 'f', 'horrible', 'fall', 'meet', 'quarter', '8th', 'grade', 'get', 'right', 'bat', 'mean', 'whirlwind', 'friendship', 'interest', 'similar', 'sense', 'humor', 'etc', 'close', 'quickly', 'thing', 'fantastic', 'year', 'later', 'high', 'school', 'couple', 'incident', 'adult', 'relative', 'sexually', 'assault', 'minor', 'preempt', 'suspicion', 'simply', 'grab', 'drink', 'water', 'take', 'grab', 'want', 'happen', 'twice', 'witness', 'occasion', 'broach', 'topic', 'intent', 'police', 'explicitly', 'tell', 'business', 'care', 'want', 'intrude', 'oblige', 'stupid', 'time', 'feel', 'particularly', 'shitty', 'weird', 'friend', 'girl', 'b', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'reason', 'get', 'head', 'entertain', 'tell', 'b', 'talk', 'badly', 'catch', 'send', 'b', 'lot', 'text', 'message', 'call', 'lot', 'mean', 'stuff', 'happen', 'like', '2012', 'zero', 'recollection', 'say', 'message', 'mean', 'end', 'goal', 'b', 'mean', 'thing', 'a.', 'idk', 'homie', 'stupid', 'high', 'school', 'bullshit', 'extraordinary', 'happen', 'friend', 'a.', 'like', 'sister', 'summer', '2016', 'make', 'friend', 'c.', 'instantly', 'hit', 'start', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'happy', 'close', 'lady', 'friend', 'c', 'happen', 'friend', 'b.', 'people', 'talk', 'thing', 'happen', 'get', 'lot', 'fun', 'screenshot', 'say', 'terrible', 'mean', 'shit', 'idea', 'say', 'yike', 'january', '2017', 'ignore', 'couple', 'day', 'send', 'obscenely', 'long', 'message', 'call', 'evil', 'go', 'bad', 'person', 'upsetting', 'read', 'honestly', 'immediately', 'react', 'delete', 'single', 'message', 'past', 'like', '8', 'year', 'block', 'social', 'medium', 'effectively', 'shut', 'emotionally', 'respond', 'message', 'c.', 'spill', 'bean', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'make', 'c', 'person', 'know', 'aside', 'c', 'gall', 'tell', 'say', 'support', 'go', 'police', 'okay', 'maybe', 'year', 'later', 'say', 'time', 'get', 'mad', 'bring', 'drop', 'subject', 'completely', 'feel', 'behavior', 'mean', 'text', 'message', 'b', 'completely', 'uncool', 'have', 'life', 'acute', 'pain', 'want', 'apologize', 'info', 'place', 'time', 'pass', 'thank', 'read', 'update', 'exactly', 'week', 'post', 'get', 'nerve', 'message', 'tell', 'fuck', 'go', 'agree', 'meet', 'talk']"

It’s sad but I want to break up with her. I’m just really not happy with the relationship anymore. She has such an aggressive personality. I should have listened to my cousin when he told me that Peru ladies were very fierce. They do have a dominant and fiery attitude and I cannot keep up with it. I want to be the man in the relationship but I just can’t play that role because my gf controls everything and when I say no, she flips and it’s world war III.

My boyfriend, Tom, has been staying with me for a few weeks due to his housing situation (new apartment wouldn’t be ready till mid June) and we’ve been discussing him just moving in with me.

He has a cat that he got about a year ago before we started dating. Unfortunately I’m allergic to cats. One of his friend’s agreed to take care of her for the month and a half he would be staying with me so it hasn’t been a problem.

Now that we’re talking about moving in together, the topic came up. Tom completely surprised me. He said it’s not right that I should be uncomfortable in my home and as long as he can find a good home for her, he is okay with giving her up.

Obviously this was pretty emotional and he was tearing up, this is a big sacrifice for him. I would never have asked him to do this, but I don’t want to say this isn’t a huge relief. I have lived with cats before and although my allergy isn’t severe, I can never just come home and relax. It’s always a constant worry about taking meds, making sure the door to the bedroom remains closed, brushing and bathing to help with allergens, making sure not to pet the cat in case I touch my face, etc.

Despite all that, I feel so guilty. He loves his cat and I don’t want to be the reason he has to give her up, and I definitely don’t him to resent me for letting him do this.

I guess I’m wondering if anyone here has been in a similar situation and how it turned out?","['23_f', 'boyfriend', '26_m', 'willing', 'pet', 'allergy', 'need', 'advice', 'post', 'r', 'relationship', 'love', 'sub', 'definitely', 'post', 'boyfriend', 'tom', 'stay', 'week', 'housing', 'situation', 'new', 'apartment', 'ready', 'till', 'mid', 'june', 'discuss', 'move', 'cat', 'get', 'year', 'ago', 'start', 'date', 'unfortunately', 'allergic', 'cat', 'friend', 'agree', 'care', 'month', 'half', 'stay', 'problem', 'talk', 'move', 'topic', 'come', 'tom', 'completely', 'surprise', 'say', 'right', 'uncomfortable', 'home', 'long', 'find', 'good', 'home', 'okay', 'give', 'obviously', 'pretty', 'emotional', 'tear', 'big', 'sacrifice', 'ask', 'want', 'huge', 'relief', 'live', 'cat', 'allergy', 'severe', 'come', 'home', 'relax', 'constant', 'worry', 'take', 'med', 'make', 'sure', 'door', 'bedroom', 'remain', 'closed', 'brushing', 'bathe', 'help', 'allergen', 'make', 'sure', 'pet', 'cat', 'case', 'touch', 'face', 'etc', 'despite', 'feel', 'guilty', 'love', 'cat', 'want', 'reason', 'definitely', 'resent', 'let', 'guess', 'wonder', 'similar', 'situation', 'turn']"

(conservative parents),"My wife and I had been having a discussion over some petty thing and i want community feedback as asking my side of family/friend would mean i would get responses in my favor. Need an unbiased opinion.

My wife's parent come from a very conservative part of India\- no meat/drinking, no pre\-marital, no live\-in before marriage etc. My wife and I were raised in USA with no barriers for most part. Long story short, got married \(obviously against her parent's will although they did happily give her away\).

Argument: My wife thinks I should respect her parent's view on No Meat/no drinking in front of them and adjust my living according to them whenever they are around. 

So, I am not a total jackass that I purposely bring my butter chicken/biryani while I am with them always. Whenever i go visit their place, i don't demand meat/liquor to accommodate my needs. If i really want to, i would go out and eat or will have a good meal when i am eating out with them. My wife thinks that out of respect for her parents i shouldn't eat or drink in front of them\- ever. If they move into our house, i have to adjust accordingly because she won't even cook meat for me in front of them. She does cook it when we are by ourselves. She also eat meat and drinks occasionally. When we met, this was never an issue \(we always went out for drinks and ate whatever we want\). What does reddit think? Who is wrong/right?

599,8jlu6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jlu6v/34m_really_complicated_story_with_an_ex_worth_a/,"[34/m] Really complicated story with an ex, worth a movie ? can't move on.","Hello, here comes a wall of text about a chunk of my life that has been ""bugging"" me and took a new turn today. It's been quite some time that I've tought about asking advice or at least taking it out of me by writing the story, the problem is that this is a story i can't share with anyone. You will understand why.



Summary of the story:
Back in October 2014 I was living with my wife and son in city A. For professional reasons she ended up living in city B with my son (400km apart) for several months and I was supposed to move to city B and join them as soon as my current work would end (it was a matter of 3 or 4 months). We were seeing each other once every 2 or 3 weeks. I started using Tinder as a hobby, with no intentions about going and seeing other girls. I actively said to my matches that I wasn't interested. Comes end of december, 3 days of work remaining and a new match with an exotic girl which style I dig very much. We connect well and I end up accepting to see her on the very last day of work in city A and leaving for good this town a few days after. We have lunch together. I'm struck by how well we connect. I'm hooked. I'm already dead inside. I tell her that I leave the city for a week of holidays (which is true) then i come back just to finalize moving my furniture the next week. I'm with my family in holidays, I'm thinking of her, I'm a bastard and i feel awful about myself. End of holidays, coming back to city A, sending text to the girl saying it's the last occasion to see each others before i move out. We spend the evening in a bar and I end up kissing her after struggling all night to not do it and having the truth about my situation on the tip of my tongue. I come back home, next morning I move out.



Texts continues, we like each others, I end up writing a long mail explaining my whole situation a few days after my coming to city B. She calls me after the mail and I later know that she didn''t really read it, for fear, she just catched some keywords and understood the situation. By phone I let my heart pour and explains that my relation with my wife is not fulfiling for a lot of reasons (i might write about that later).



I don't really recall exactly all the details but a few weeks later I lie to my wife saying that I need to go back to city A for work. I see the girl. We sleep with each others. At this point It's not physical. I really like her. like love. It's the first time I do that in my whole life, lying, cheating. I feel like complete crap, i betrayed everyone including myself.  
My wife announces me that I'm going to be a father for the second time. I already betrayed her. I'm shit.
Things go on like this (me lying to go to city A) for a few weeks, I'm becoming weird. Once when I'm with her, I get a call from work asking me if i want a mission abroad (Madrid). I don't think much before saying yes. She is south american and spanish. I can escape reality for a few months.



My behavior with my phone is weird. I'm caught by my wife. Terrible fight. I say it's over (i believe in what i say) because I feel awful. 2 weeks later I'm in Madrid. This was not planned but she comes visit me there. I book a hotel for the 4 days she's here. The phone rings in the room, this is my wife. I have no idea how she found us. Her dad has connections. Terrible fight by phone. We decide it's over for real with the girl. I sometimes visit my family in France and once I join them in city A because they still have connections here. Everybody in her family sees it doesn't work, they see me miserable, i fucking cry in front of my wife's mother. They convince me that I have to go ""live what I have to live with the girl"", whatever that means. They don't have to push me very much. I'm weak at that point. I go back to madrid by plane next morning but I leave them this night and go back to the girl's appartement to pass the night.



Our relation with the girl is easy. She is much closer to me in term of mindset, way of seeing life, artistic sensibility etc. She's by a lot of aspects perfect to live with for me. This shit continues for a few months,i don't see her much cause I'm still in Madrid and when i come back home I try to go 30% in city A and 70% to city B to see my son. At some point I don't recall the details, but I end up the thing again. Saying that this is not a way to live. Not fair to anyone. I come back from madrid and we move in together with my wife, my son and my newly born daughter to a new place. But I can't go away from the girl completely. Still sending texts and calling her. My relation with my wife is bad. She is marvelous, way better than me and copes with things I can't imagine. Still she has her pride, and i want to suffer from what I do. 



Comes the ""anniversary"" of our meeting with the girl, 18th of december. Last day of work before holidays. Don't know if it has a connection but when coming back home from work I have a terrible motorbike accident. I lost memories of that day. My right knee and elbow are destroyed. I wake up in the hospital 3 days later with steel bars coming out of my leg. I slowly realize how fucked I am. There are too many pieces of my knee articulation to count. Few days later in the hospital, I learn that my wife has called the girl to warn her. The girl comes down to city B and my wife picks her up at the train station to bring her to me at the hospital (I know the whole thing is scarily weird, and it's not over). We see each other a few minutes. 10 days later I leave the hospital for a rehabilitation center. At this point we broke up with my wife. By respect to her, to make things clear if that's possible.  We are officially broken up. I'm not ""with"" the other girl either. But we are still in contact while I'm at the center. I suffer. A lot. My wishes came true i guess. I stay there 3 months. Finally I'm out, I'm all broken up, can barely walk with canes but I convince the girl that we belong together and now that I'm clear with my wife it's gonna be better. I organize to go to city B regularly. From April to August this goes on like this. I realize that she is not so perfect. Details but not perfect. Sexually it's Ok, but with my wife it's perfect. I realize that me being older and her still being a student may be a problem financially wise to do things I dream of (travelling round the world etc.) unless I pay (which i cannot do). I realize that now that there are no obstacles to our love, this may not be so exciting. I realize that I won't ever have my mind at ease if i ""abandon"" my children (for me living away from them is already abandoning them), I can't enjoy our relationship, I love her. She is my soulmate, i tell her that, she tells me that, i believe it but I can't enjoy it and I can't imagine a situation where I can. Not with a 3 yo and 6 months old children that will suffer from this. I end it in August. for real, for good. At first there are few texts still. Soon there are less and less. Soon there are none. In one of the last she tells me that our relation bought her more bad things that good ones. I'm hurt. I'm hurt because i've been truer to her than to anybody and despite my lies I've loved her so much. I'm also hurt because she doesn't seem to realize that in this story she lost so much less than everybody else involved. I forever marked my family with what I did. I'm hurt because I don't want to hurt anybody. 



Since then I managed to re-conquer my wife, because it was the thing to do, because I love her, because my children. It goes ok. The things that made me wander off the road are still there. I'm not fulfilled, but sometimes I find comfort in my life especially with my children. And I check the public instagram of the girl every day to catch a glimpse of her. She is not very productive on it so I watch the same photos and videos like treasures, trying to detect if she found somebody else. It's been 1 year since we last exchanged. I think I tried twice a direct contact since but no answer. And today her instagram went private. I'm completely cut off and it is incredible how I'm affected by it. I can't let go and I don't know what to do. You'd know me in real life, you wouldn't imagine how weak I am to this. I tried to subscribe to her feed. She ofc rejected it. It tried to contact her BFF with a tearful message explaning that i was sorry if I hurt her and that I hope she's ok (I think we are around the anniversary of her dad's death, so she may not).



I needed to talk, I have no one to talk to about this. I'll take any advice. I can add some details if needed. I'll take insults. Anything.

(20M)(18F),"My girlfriend and I are taking a break because she says shes really stressed out with my mom.  She thinks that my mom does not like her, however, that is not the case at all.  My mom teases us for fun but is not serious about it. I talked to my mom about it and she was very shocked to hear that my girlfriend thinks my mom doesnt like her.  My mom even texted my girlfriend saying that is not true at all and is sorry if it was interpreted that way. I came back from college on Friday, so a couple of days ago after a 400 mile drive.  We are in a LDR relationship and she will be entering college this fall and I am a rising junior in mine.  We have been dating for a little over 2 1/2 years and as soon as I came back, she decided to talk to me about it.  

She started crying and saying ""I cant lose you but im not happy.""  Of course I want her to be happy more than anything but I think everything is piling on her.  She has college, her career, and other things that are stressing her out.  She asked what should we do?  I said to her, I think we should take a break to think about us.  I gave told her that this friday we can come back together and talk about what we should do.  Obviously, I want to keep seeing this girl.  I love her so dearly.  I am not too sure how to start the conversation and should I get her a nice thoughtful gift?

Met someone while separated and we've dating for a little over a year.  We're exclusive, but the gf says we're ""unofficial"" simply because we haven't met each other's parents.

My parents (70F/72M) are still grieving my divorce and are not over my ex-wife yet.  They're not willing to accept my new girlfriend because they feel she's the reason I left my ex-wife.

While I understand her position, my parents are not ready to meet her.  This is pushing her away from our relationship as she's been arguing that it's not giving her an identity other than ""the other woman,"" arguing that the parents don't accept how supportive she's been, helping me through the divorce, day-to-day struggles, etc.

I've tried re-assuring her but she feels that it's always something preventing us from progressing our relationship and that I'm always giving her excuses.

I've made a throwaway for.. well, reasons. My Boyfriend knows my username and I just want to get the opinion from others.

please don't respond with ""omg, age gap"" or ""leave him"". I don't want to leave him. I love him and I don't know how to bring this up to him, in the most mature way possible. I've the feeling he doesn't get it when something upsets me.

**basic info:** I'm in my end\-20s, my SO is in his 40s. both guys, together for 2 years. spending time with family and friends often. don't life together.

***I'm so sorry, this post got out of hand. I was writing and writing without paying attention to the length. I've tried to organise it.***

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

ok, there are a couple of things that happened the last couple of months aka.

# things that bother me

* **the photo together \- we don't have a picture together**for quite a while I asked him for a picture together. He always responds with ""yeah, one day"" or with a joke. most of the times I really don't mind. But we have no picutre together. We went on holiday a couple weeks ago and all the pictures I have are bad looking selfies or pictures with his mother in the background. I'd love to hang a picture at onto the wall or something.
* **the picture from his ex \- he has a picture of his ex and himself on his smartphone.** I'm not a picture Nazi. Not at all. I think having pictures of an ex is ok, as long as it's a normal picture from a meorable time together \(like, a picture from holiday,..\) and if it's stored on a hard disk somewhere along all other momories. he talked about smartphone and whatsapp and he noticed that I have a different view on my phone. I can few just whatsapp or just camera photos. he asked me, if where to set this options. I showed him. he scrolled throu his folders \(each one with the first picture showing\) and I saw a folder called ""Pictures"" with him and another guy. Looking happy, cute together. I asked him, if this was his Ex\-Boyfriend. He said yes and seemed kind of confused why I was upset about it. After asking me if I'm really that bothered by it, I told him, that I'm very upset because we don't have one together and asked him to at least put it somewhere not that visible. He told me he's going to delete it. Really childish move on my part, I couldn't resist. I looked at his phone the other day. He didn't remove the picture from his phone.
* **anniversary \- not that important for him.** ok, this one is kind of tough. We met on a dating platform two years ago. We don't plan for a relationship. It just happened. Maybe I'm old fashioned. But I love having a date to say ""Honey, it's been 2 years since we are seeing each other. I love you"" along with a nice dinner \(eating out or home made\) and maybe a rose for him. I really want something like that. I don't want fancy presents or facebook posts or anything. But I want to know that my partner is happy to have me around. yes, yes maybe that's cheesy. So, a couple weeks back I asked him how to handle that. I never got a clear response. I told him this weekend ""wow, crazy how fast the last 2 years flew by. on thu we met 2 years ago"". I've asked him about that particular day, what he was doing and if he's ok with my sleeping at his place. His working hours are 1 early week, 1 late week. mine are 7am to 7pm \(or longer\) \- he's on his late week and is home at 11pm. he doesn't need to get up early the next day. and he told me, he rather wants another day. ok,... even this is fine for me. This morning after waking up I wrote him an message, saying I love him and I'm happy to have him on my side. What's his response? ""😂"" followed by ""oh btw. can you order me \_\_ from amazon?""
* **we spent the holiday with his mother and spend time 24/7**two weeks, caribean. with his mother and a friend of hers. For me it's was really hard to have her around me the entire time \(we had seperate bedrooms tho\). I know my family wouldn't spend the entire day with us or at least give up an evening together. I booked a dinner for us \(for $70/each\) at the beach. I told his mother that I'd love to spend one evening with him alone \(again, a friend of hers was with us.. she was not alone\) \- and she was super upset because I even considered not taking them with us. That day she told him ""she was not feeling well"" and was playing dying swan. I cancled the surprise dinner because my boyfriend was worried about his mother. I wrote my mom that I was hurt and wrote something along the lines ""It feels like I'm a random guest at the vacation from BF and his mom, and not our vacation"". He saw the message and asked me, if I had a problem with his mom. I told him, yes. I was telling him how much I'd love to spend an evening together just with him. 1 or 2 evening with him alone in 2 weeks are not that much.
* **cancled cinema with my collegues**I wanted to see Ready Player One at the cinema. He knew. Two collegues at work asked me if we wanted to join. I told them I want to join them and let them know if my BF wants too. I asked him, if he wants to see the movie with us and he told us yes. Ok, so, 4 tickets please. His work schedule changed and he was not able to see the movie. I asked him, if he wants to see it with me or if he'd be bothered if I go. He told me he'd love to see the movie with me \- so I cancled my ticket. A week after I asked him, when he wants to see it. He told me that he doesn't really want to see the movie but much rather want to watch the avengers. What the... fuck. I was really pissed because I was curious about RPO for a while. I wouldn't mind if he told me this from the beginning. I would not drag him to a movie he's not into. But making my cancle my plan was just an unnecessary move.

I know, for some people it's not that important. But for me they are. I've talked to him last weekend \(we had a mature talk for about two hours\) \- outside of the bedroom on a park bench outside. So, no sexual background while talking.

I told him, that I'm really upset with those things \(picture together, picture of his ex\) and asked him, if it's possible he's not recognizing, if i'm upset or joking. He told be that indeed he has a lot of troubles with that. I asked how to proceed and how to let him know, how to handle things better. He asked me to tell him in an moment like we had then. Sit him down and talk to him. No TV in the background, not in the bedroom etc. So I told him again, that I was actually hurt about stuff like that.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

TL;DR: I'm upset because my boyfriend doesn't care about things like I do. Told him and talked to him about things that bother me and he said he's going to be more careful. doesn't do anything.

How to sit him down again and let him know i'm actually really hurt by...  disinterest to change those promised things.","['let', 'know', 'upset', 'view', 'thing', 'm28', 'm42', '2yr', 'relationship', 'hello', 'guy', 'lurk', 'main', 'reddit', 'account', 'throwaway', 'reason', 'boyfriend', 'know', 'username', 'want', 'opinion', 'respond', 'omg', 'age', 'gap', 'leave', 'want', 'leave', 'love', 'know', 'bring', 'mature', 'way', 'possible', 'feeling', 'upset', 'basic', 'info', 'end', '-20_s', '40_', 'guy', '2', 'year', 'spend', 'time', 'family', 'friend', 'life', 'sorry', 'post', 'get', 'hand', 'write', 'write', 'pay', 'attention', 'length', 'try', 'organise', 'ok', 'couple', 'thing', 'happen', 'couple', 'month', 'aka', 'thing', 'bother', 'photo', 'picture', 'together**for', 'ask', 'picture', 'respond', 'yeah', 'day', 'joke', 'time', 'mind', 'picutre', 'go', 'holiday', 'couple', 'week', 'ago', 'picture', 'bad', 'look', 'selfie', 'picture', 'mother', 'background', 'love', 'hang', 'picture', 'wall', 'picture', 'ex', 'picture', 'ex', 'smartphone', 'picture', 'nazi', 'think', 'have', 'picture', 'ex', 'ok', 'long', 'normal', 'picture', 'meorable', 'time', 'like', 'picture', 'holiday', 'store', 'hard', 'disk', 'momorie', 'talk', 'smartphone', 'whatsapp', 'notice', 'different', 'view', 'phone', 'whatsapp', 'camera', 'photo', 'ask', 'set', 'option', 'show', 'scroll', 'throu', 'folder', 'picture', 'show', 'see', 'folder', 'call', 'picture', 'guy', 'look', 'happy', 'cute', 'ask', 'ex', '-boyfriend', 'say', 'yes', 'kind', 'confused', 'upset', 'ask', 'bother', 'tell', 'upset', 'ask', 'visible', 'tell', 'go', 'delete', 'childish', 'resist', 'look', 'phone', 'day', 'remove', 'picture', 'phone', 'anniversary', 'important', 'ok', 'kind', 'tough', 'meet', 'date', 'platform', 'year', 'ago', 'plan', 'relationship', 'happen', 'maybe', 'old', 'fashioned', 'love', 'have', 'date', 'honey', '2', 'year', 'see', 'love', 'nice', 'dinner', 'eat', 'home', 'maybe', 'rose', 'want', 'like', 'want', 'fancy', 'present', 'facebook', 'post', 'want', 'know', 'partner', 'happy', 'yes', 'yes', 'maybe', 'cheesy', 'couple', 'week', 'ask', 'handle', 'get', 'clear', 'response', 'tell', 'weekend', 'wow', 'crazy', 'fast', '2', 'year', 'fly', 'thu', 'meet', '2', 'year', 'ago', 'ask', 'particular', 'day', 'ok', 'sleeping', 'place', 'work', 'hour', '1', 'early', 'week', '1', 'late', 'week', '7', '7', 'p.m.', 'long', 'late', 'week', 'home', '11', 'p.m.', 'need', 'early', 'day', 'tell', 'want', 'day', 'ok', 'fine', 'morning', 'wake', 'write', 'message', 'say', 'love', 'happy', 'response', '😂', 'follow', 'oh', 'btw', 'order', 'amazon', 'spend', 'holiday', 'mother', 'spend', 'time', '24/7**two', 'week', 'caribean', 'mother', 'friend', 'hard', 'entire', 'time', 'seperate', 'bedroom', 'tho', 'know', 'family', 'spend', 'entire', 'day', 'evening', 'book', 'dinner', '$', '70', 'beach', 'tell', 'mother', 'love', 'spend', 'evening', 'friend', 'super', 'upset', 'consider', 'take', 'day', 'tell', 'feel', 'play', 'die', 'swan', 'cancle', 'surprise', 'dinner', 'boyfriend', 'worried', 'mother', 'write', 'mom', 'hurt', 'write', 'line', 'feel', 'like', 'random', 'guest', 'vacation', 'bf', 'mom', 'vacation', 'see', 'message', 'ask', 'problem', 'mom', 'tell', 'yes', 'tell', 'love', 'spend', 'evening', '1', '2', 'evening', '2', 'week', 'cancle', 'cinema', 'collegues**i', 'want', 'ready', 'player', 'cinema', 'know', 'collegue', 'work', 'ask', 'want', 'join', 'tell', 'want', 'join', 'let', 'know', 'bf', 'want', 'ask', 'want', 'movie', 'tell', 'yes', 'ok', '4', 'ticket', 'work', 'schedule', 'change', 'able', 'movie', 'ask', 'want', 'bother', 'tell', 'love', 'movie', 'cancle', 'ticket', 'week', 'ask', 'want', 'tell', 'want', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'avenger', 'fuck', 'pissed', 'curious', 'rpo', 'mind', 'tell', 'beginning', 'drag', 'movie', 'make', 'cancle', 'plan', 'unnecessary', 'know', 'people', 'important', 'talk', 'weekend', 'mature', 'talk', 'hour', 'outside', 'bedroom', 'park', 'bench', 'outside', 'sexual', 'background', 'talk', 'tell', 'upset', 'thing', 'picture', 'picture', 'ex', 'ask', 'possible', 'recognize', 'upset', 'joke', 'tell', 'lot', 'trouble', 'ask', 'proceed', 'let', 'know', 'handle', 'thing', 'well', 'ask', 'tell', 'moment', 'like', 'sit', 'talk', 'tv', 'background', 'bedroom', 'etc', 'tell', 'actually', 'hurt', 'stuff', 'like', 'tl;dr', 'upset', 'boyfriend', 'care', 'thing', 'like', 'tell', 'talk', 'thing', 'bother', 'say', 'go', 'careful', 'sit', 'let', 'know', 'actually', 'hurt', 'disinterest', 'change', 'promise', 'thing']"
603,8jlm5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jlm5r/my_19f_boyfriend_19m_is_gaining_weight/,My [19F] boyfriend [19M] is gaining weight,"Hi! My boyfriend and I met when we were 12 on an online game, and we have offically been together for almost four years. He is a great boyfriend, and I do adore and love him a lot. Fyi we are also having a ldr and live in two different countries.

My problem has been that he has gained quite a bit of weight the past year. He is on antidepressiva and I could understand that that is something that can contribute to it, but all he does besides school is to game. When he once got his weight and BMI checked he realized where this was going and started working out a bit. I was thrilled about this because he never wanted to go to the gym with me earlier, but now we finally could, and he seemed to enjoy it a lot too! 

Fast forward some months till today. Now he has lost the motivation to go train, and he has had a rough period again but is doing a lot better now. I am trying to motivate and help him in any way I can, but I think by now he is just finding it annoying and not helpful. I would suggest us to go work out at the same time (which seemed to be a big motivator before his rough period), I would help him make goals to work towards and I would be supportive and positive in any way I could. He also helped and motivated me.

The reason why I find this tough is that I am very focused on health. I feel worried and stressed that all he does is just to sit on his butt and game all day. This is also something I find less and less attractive. He has said he does not like the way he looks and that he would like to change, but it seems like he just won’t do anything about it anymore. As if he has given up. I feel very sad about the situation. I am terrified about death, and I really do not want him to leave me earlier than neccessary. Due to weightgain he has also changed alot when it comes to the way he looks. I feel like a bad girlfriend for finding him less attractive and wanting him to lose weight. 

I do believe he wants to lose weight and to be healthy, and he still wants to work out with me when I am around.

I am not sure what to do about this situation really, if there even is anything I can do. I kind of just wanna skip some years into the future to the day I have moved to his country and we live together, so I can learn him how to cook and so we can be active together. 

Sorry if this turned out a bit messy! This is my first post here and I have social anxiety, so my heart is literally racing like crazy right now.. I hope no one takes my post the wrong way, and please ask for clarification if something seems a bit unclear etc.

edit: my boyfriend also got autism and he tends to take personal things the wrong way or too personal, which often ends with him getting angry. This is also why I hesitate with voicing out my opinion in this case too much.

tldr: my boyfriend is gaining weight and feels unhappy about it. I want to help, but I am not sure how to do it without sounding so annoying or ‘nag like a mother’.","['19_f', 'boyfriend', '19_m', 'gain', 'weight', 'hi', 'boyfriend', 'meet', '12', 'online', 'game', 'offically', 'year', 'great', 'boyfriend', 'adore', 'love', 'lot', 'fyi', 'have', 'ldr', 'live', 'different', 'country', 'problem', 'gain', 'bit', 'weight', 'past', 'year', 'antidepressiva', 'understand', 'contribute', 'school', 'game', 'get', 'weight', 'bmi', 'check', 'realize', 'go', 'start', 'work', 'bit', 'thrill', 'want', 'gym', 'early', 'finally', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'fast', 'forward', 'month', 'till', 'today', 'lose', 'motivation', 'train', 'rough', 'period', 'lot', 'well', 'try', 'motivate', 'help', 'way', 'think', 'find', 'annoying', 'helpful', 'suggest', 'work', 'time', 'big', 'motivator', 'rough', 'period', 'help', 'goal', 'work', 'supportive', 'positive', 'way', 'help', 'motivate', 'reason', 'find', 'tough', 'focused', 'health', 'feel', 'worried', 'stress', 'sit', 'butt', 'game', 'day', 'find', 'attractive', 'say', 'like', 'way', 'look', 'like', 'change', 'like', 'will', 'anymore', 'give', 'feel', 'sad', 'situation', 'terrify', 'death', 'want', 'leave', 'early', 'neccessary', 'weightgain', 'change', 'alot', 'come', 'way', 'look', 'feel', 'like', 'bad', 'girlfriend', 'find', 'attractive', 'want', 'lose', 'weight', 'believe', 'want', 'lose', 'weight', 'healthy', 'want', 'work', 'sure', 'situation', 'kind', 'wanna', 'skip', 'year', 'future', 'day', 'move', 'country', 'live', 'learn', 'cook', 'active', 'sorry', 'turn', 'bit', 'messy', 'post', 'social', 'anxiety', 'heart', 'literally', 'race', 'like', 'crazy', 'right', 'hope', 'take', 'post', 'wrong', 'way', 'ask', 'clarification', 'bit', 'unclear', 'etc', 'edit', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'autism', 'tend', 'personal', 'thing', 'wrong', 'way', 'personal', 'end', 'get', 'angry', 'hesitate', 'voice', 'opinion', 'case', 'tldr', 'boyfriend', 'gain', 'weight', 'feel', 'unhappy', 'want', 'help', 'sure', 'sound', 'annoying', 'nag', 'like', 'mother']"

We have one little girl who will be four this year. After we graduated HS we moved to the city for college. He dropped out after one semester and I kept going. He didn't work, but I did. Things continued like this for a while. He got a short term job with a flower merchandising company (because of me) but didn't work again after that ended. Fast forward a few years, I'm struggling with trying to manage school, work, bills, and struggling with severe depression. He still wasn't working. Fast forward another year. I dropped out of college to work full time and was pregnant. He's found a crappy part time job after I threatened to leave. Pregnancy goes by and it wasn't easy. I had severe preclampsia and almost died during childbirth (the doctors came out and told my mom and husband that they weren't sure I was going to make it). I pulled through, suffered severe post partum depression and numerous health problems. He quit his job when my daughter was two months old. I had to get cleared from the doctor to end my maternity leave early and go back to work. We moved back home when our daughter was five months old. We lived with his family for a year. I worked, he didn't and I funded almost the entire wedding. I got him a job with my company and we bought a house. A few weeks after we closed he got fired (not his fault, crappy situation with crappy people) and cut our income in half. He's still not working. I was diagnosed with diabetes as a result of my pregnancy, and it's been hell. It's been about three years. He's been attending college, but semesters keep magically appearing to the amount of time he has left, he says he can't work because it doesn't fit with this school schedule, and when he's home with the baby he doesn't do anything around the house. 

I finally told him about two weeks ago that I've had enough and I was thinking about filing for divorce if things don't change. Since then he has been cleaning the house and looking for work. I'm not putting him completely at fault and share the blame for the distance in the relationship. We don't really have sex. That's a problem on me because over the years I just grew increasingly asexual (because of our living situation and stress) and ultimately unattracted to him in that way. When we do have sex, there's no passion in it and it just doesn't feel the same. We have a tentative cease fire on the divorce for now and he wants to try to work things out. My issue is he's doing everything I've asked him to do and he seems to think that everything is well and good and all behind us. He seems to think that I've just forgiven him or whatever and is going about business as usual. But I still feel like our marriage is broken. Am I being unrealistic in my expectations? I feel like he's just writing off what is essentially 8 years of neglect. I'm going to talk to a therapist to work through some of my own issues, but that doesn't help me now.","['27', 'f', 'husband', '27', 'm', 'contemplate', 'divorce', 'think', 'take', 'seriously', 'little', 'backstory-', '11', 'year', 'marry', '2', 'little', 'girl', 'year', 'graduate', 'hs', 'move', 'city', 'college', 'drop', 'semester', 'keep', 'go', 'work', 'thing', 'continue', 'like', 'get', 'short', 'term', 'job', 'flower', 'merchandise', 'company', 'work', 'end', 'fast', 'forward', 'year', 'struggle', 'try', 'manage', 'school', 'work', 'bill', 'struggle', 'severe', 'depression', 'work', 'fast', 'forward', 'year', 'drop', 'college', 'work', 'time', 'pregnant', 'find', 'crappy', 'time', 'job', 'threaten', 'leave', 'pregnancy', 'go', 'easy', 'severe', 'preclampsia', 'die', 'childbirth', 'doctor', 'come', 'tell', 'mom', 'husband', 'sure', 'go', 'pull', 'suffer', 'severe', 'post', 'partum', 'depression', 'numerous', 'health', 'problem', 'quit', 'job', 'daughter', 'month', 'old', 'clear', 'doctor', 'end', 'maternity', 'leave', 'early', 'work', 'move', 'home', 'daughter', 'month', 'old', 'live', 'family', 'year', 'work', 'fund', 'entire', 'wedding', 'get', 'job', 'company', 'buy', 'house', 'week', 'close', 'get', 'fire', 'fault', 'crappy', 'situation', 'crappy', 'people', 'cut', 'income', 'half', 'work', 'diagnose', 'diabetes', 'result', 'pregnancy', 'hell', 'year', 'attend', 'college', 'semester', 'magically', 'appear', 'time', 'leave', 'say', 'work', 'fit', 'school', 'schedule', 'home', 'baby', 'house', 'finally', 'tell', 'week', 'ago', 'think', 'file', 'divorce', 'thing', 'change', 'clean', 'house', 'look', 'work', 'put', 'completely', 'fault', 'share', 'blame', 'distance', 'relationship', 'sex', 'problem', 'year', 'grow', 'increasingly', 'asexual', 'live', 'situation', 'stress', 'ultimately', 'unattracted', 'way', 'sex', 'passion', 'feel', 'tentative', 'cease', 'fire', 'divorce', 'want', 'try', 'work', 'thing', 'issue', 'ask', 'think', 'good', 'think', 'forgive', 'go', 'business', 'usual', 'feel', 'like', 'marriage', 'break', 'unrealistic', 'expectation', 'feel', 'like', 'write', 'essentially', '8', 'year', 'neglect', 'go', 'talk', 'therapist', 'work', 'issue', 'help']"

There’s a huge story behind why this is occurring, but I think it’s best summed up with: he had an extremely shitty childhood that fucked him up so bad that he came out with a whole slew of problems. I don’t personally mind this because he’s still great all around, but there are needs of his I can’t meet due to how he is socially/mentally/sexually. Right now, he’s basically tired of just the two of us doing the naughty and because of his social and sexual needs, he wants to open the relationship up so he can go to other people and have flings basically. This is opened for me too which I appreciate him for. We’ve already talked about how it would work extensively last night and we’re going to be sitting down again this morning after he comes back from a brunch with coworkers to talk about it more. I would appreciate some opinions about this though, especially if you’ve been in an open relationship as well. bf and I already talked and I wanted to make sure this wouldn’t turn into him maintaining multiple relationships (aka being poly) which he thankfully gave me a weird look and reaffirmed no and that he would only be committed to me relationship wise while anything sexual would be stands. There’s also the fact we share a little townhouse now and he’s already iterated that he’s bringing no one here out of respect for me (we also have a lot of expensive stuff but that only came up when we thought about it). There’s a lot we already discussed and we’re taking our time with this decision because he knows it’s a lot for me and initially didn’t want to ask, but he’s thankful that I’m giving it thought. I know I’m leaving a lot out right now mostly because they fall more into the common sense category or because it’s something more to do with his personality specifically. Advice and opinions are appreciated though.","['opinion', 'open', 'relationship', '21_f', '23_m', 'brief', 'summary', 'guy', 'year', 'complete', 'gaming', 'geek', 'love', 'anime', 'etc', 'basically', 'bf', 'ask', 'open', 'relationship', 'personally', 'huge', 'story', 'occur', 'think', 'well', 'sum', 'extremely', 'shitty', 'childhood', 'fuck', 'bad', 'come', 'slew', 'problem', 'personally', 'mind', 'great', 'need', 'meet', 'socially', 'mentally', 'sexually', 'right', 'basically', 'tired', 'naughty', 'social', 'sexual', 'need', 'want', 'open', 'relationship', 'people', 'fling', 'basically', 'open', 'appreciate', 'talk', 'work', 'extensively', 'night', 'go', 'sit', 'morning', 'come', 'brunch', 'coworker', 'talk', 'appreciate', 'opinion', 'especially', 'open', 'relationship', 'bf', 'talk', 'want', 'sure', 'turn', 'maintain', 'multiple', 'relationship', 'aka', 'poly', 'thankfully', 'give', 'weird', 'look', 'reaffirm', 'commit', 'relationship', 'wise', 'sexual', 'stand', 'fact', 'share', 'little', 'townhouse', 'iterate', 'bring', 'respect', 'lot', 'expensive', 'stuff', 'come', 'think', 'lot', 'discuss', 'take', 'time', 'decision', 'know', 'lot', 'initially', 'want', 'ask', 'thankful', 'give', 'think', 'know', 'leave', 'lot', 'right', 'fall', 'common', 'sense', 'category', 'personality', 'specifically', 'advice', 'opinion', 'appreciate']"

608,8jkkrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jkkrp/i_24m_started_seeing_a_girl_19f_and_over_the/,I [24M] started seeing a girl [19F] and over the space of the weekend she's told me never to contact her again,"Apologise in advance for the long one and the probably poor formatting. Also, apologies for the potentially useless details. I'm not good at cutting out useless bits, need to work on it. 

So I've started going back to the gym recently, lost 8kgs and a lot of confidence. 
Anyway, I was at the gym and I noticed a really, really beautiful girl (call her Nora). Very smiley and happy, and was drawing a lot of attention. I didn't know how or if to approach her and say hello. I'm very shy, very nervous and don't even know what do in that situation! So I left it. 

I then went to the gym with my best friend, he turned out to know this girl very well,  she's the half-sister of his girlfriend. This prompted conversation between the 3 of us and Nora was even more lovely to speak to. Really chirpy and full on energy. 

I've carried on going to the gym and now that I'd met Nora we'd talk quite often and walk home after every gym session. 
Nora then added me on social media and we started talking more and more. Organising to go to the gym and talking about maybe watching a film together. 
But before it went any further I told her that I was off travelling again in 2 months, just so she knew and could think about where it was going. 

We carried on hanging out loads, slept together a few times and then the last time we slept together we agreed that it was going to stop. This is because it was getting a bit more like it was leading somewhere and we both knew I was leaving soon. 

Carried on going to gym and seeing each other then, but it felt like nothing had changed. Still very attracted to each other and close. I asked her if she'd like so come around to cook a dinner and to watch a film, Nora said yes and we had a really fun night. We kissed a bit. Admittedly we were both in the wrong form going back on what we'd agreed. But neither of us protested. 

The next day Nora called me and all I heard was ""you've really mugged me off"" then the connection failed. 
I messaged her asking what that meant and she said that someone had told her that I'd been sleeping with 2 other girls on the side. 
I had slept with 2 girls, but they were both months ago. Before I'd even met Nora, before I even knew Nora existed! 
She wouldn't believe me when I told her that it wasn't true and then blocked me from contacting her via Facebook messenger. So I texted her and asked her to please listen to me, I explained about the rumour of the 2 girls and about how they were before I'd even met her. She told me not to contact her again and was very hostile and blunt. 

I spent the whole weekend feeling like a piece of shit, being ignored and not being believed even though I was honest. 

I spoke to my best friend about it and showed him the conversations and how nasty she was being. Then he said I'm surprised she hasn't told you yet, but she's back with her ex. 

So now I'm really dazed, confused and hurt. Really lost as to what to do now :s 
Any help or suggestions is greatly appreciated as well as anything else. Very open to comments etc! 

Tl;dr: Started seeing a girl, ended up liking her, accused of sleeping with other girls, told me never to contact her again, found out she's back with ex... Uhh yeah

We text and call everyday for hours on end and our conversations virtually do not end.

He is usually the one to initiate the conversations and always calls me at the end of the day for no particular reason. It was very sweet at first but recently it's been becoming intrusive to my life and work. 

He is truly a nice guy who is very down-to earth and he is always there for me when I need emotional support. That is why I fell for him at the start. But he seems to always need to be around me and texting/calling me. Whenever I try to leave or say goodbye, he basically guilt trips me for not giving him my full attention 24/7. 

He has quite a number of friends and is a really affectionate person in general. I don't really know if he is flirting or just very affectionate, especially toward other girls he would always hug them and have his arm around their waist. But he also hugs guys too so maybe I'm in the wrong here ( he is straight ).

I always catch him sneaking glances at me and being really close to me, subconsciously touching me many times. But this may reflect back to what I said in the previous paragraph. Also he constantly says that he loves/likes me etc as a joke, but I'm 99% sure he is not a player or anything like that.

He has had a tough life in the past so sometimes he is not quite himself, and I make sure that I am there for him if he needs. I really do like him and do see a potential relationship with him but I don't want to start anything and then find out that he is very needy and have to break it off.


TL;DR I really like him and his personality, I really do, but it has been confusing me recently because he seems to be quite needy. He gets angry at me when I try to leave to get things done. Am I just getting sick of him or are there red flags that I should be seeing?

610,8jk7by,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jk7by/my_college_crushfriend_26f_has_got_back_in_touch/,My college crush/friend (26f) has got back in touch with me (27m) after several years of no real contact. Does it sound like a good idea to go for it with this relationship?,"This girl shared my class and major at a small private college, so there was plenty of opportunity for us to become acquainted. And we did, I immediately fell in love with her and had a painfully strong crush on her for 3 years. We first became friends, I was her only male friend and so our friendship alone was quite strong and important to both of us, we were study partners/lab partners etc. pretty much constantly due to our shared major. But I had this powerful crush and so I did try to become more than friends.

She maintained consistently that she simply didn't want a boyfriend yet, she was inexperienced and didn't feel ready. I said that it was fine but occasionally we did kiss, we made out a few times, but she would always abruptly cut things off and reiterate her ""no boyfriend"" policy. In our last year I felt so rejected that the sight of her became painful and I tried to bury my feelings for her and so our friendship gradually died and we didn't have much contact after we graduated.

We met again when I returned to our home city \(where the college is located\) when mutual friends \(who always said we were meant to be a couple, whatever that means\) got us together. I succeeded in my goal of entering and completing med school \(graduated a year ago, hurray!\) and she was clearly impressed that I was a ""doctor"" now, she said that she always knew I was an amazing science student and that I would do what I wished to in life, but she did still seem to look at me differently now than when I was just a dorky student in college. This girl, my former crush \(call her K.\), seems to be extremely into me now.

Pretty much the first question she asked me was so direct that I think I blushed, she asked if I was married or had a girlfriend yet. When I said no, she even pressed me further and asked if I had a girlfriend at all in the years since we were in college \(I answered ""no"", sadly the truth\). And at this point she was clearly extremely happy, she couldn't conceal her happiness at my not having had a girlfriend. Since our meeting she has actually pursued me \(even though she is the woman, and it's still kinda weird socially\), asking me to hang out a bunch of times. Each time I see her face all of the feelings I had for her rush back and I'm just a lovesick 20 year old college student again. We've been making out but that's it as far as physical affection has gone.

I told her all the misery I went through because of her \(I guess it's my fault too, I can't blame her for my feelings for her\) and she explained that she really, honestly was afraid of having a bf at the time, her father forbade her from it \(even though she was a legal adult living in college dorms, I know it's weird, but it's true\), she is from a very strict Catholic household, and all these things made it genuinely as hard for her as it was for me.

My best friend thinks that K. is only after me now because I'm a doctor \(which means a lot less than most people think, trust me\) and when I was a dorky biochem student with a massive crush she simply used me for academic help and to stroke her vanity. Does it sound, from an outside perspective, that my friend is correct, or should I just follow my feelings and get the girl I wanted so bad \(and still honestly do\).","['college', 'crush', 'friend', '26_f', 'get', 'touch', '27_m', 'year', 'real', 'contact', 'sound', 'like', 'good', 'idea', 'relationship', 'girl', 'share', 'class', 'major', 'small', 'private', 'college', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'acquaint', 'immediately', 'fall', 'love', 'painfully', 'strong', 'crush', '3', 'year', 'friend', 'male', 'friend', 'friendship', 'strong', 'important', 'study', 'partner', 'lab', 'partner', 'etc', 'pretty', 'constantly', 'share', 'major', 'powerful', 'crush', 'try', 'friend', 'maintain', 'consistently', 'simply', 'want', 'boyfriend', 'inexperienced', 'feel', 'ready', 'say', 'fine', 'occasionally', 'kiss', 'time', 'abruptly', 'cut', 'thing', 'reiterate', 'boyfriend', 'policy', 'year', 'feel', 'reject', 'sight', 'painful', 'try', 'bury', 'feeling', 'friendship', 'gradually', 'die', 'contact', 'graduate', 'meet', 'return', 'home', 'city', 'college', 'locate', 'mutual', 'friend', 'say', 'mean', 'couple', 'mean', 'get', 'succeed', 'goal', 'enter', 'complete', 'med', 'school', 'graduate', 'year', 'ago', 'hurray', 'clearly', 'impressed', 'doctor', 'say', 'know', 'amazing', 'science', 'student', 'wish', 'life', 'look', 'differently', 'dorky', 'student', 'college', 'girl', 'crush', 'k.', 'extremely', 'pretty', 'question', 'ask', 'direct', 'think', 'blush', 'ask', 'married', 'girlfriend', 'say', 'press', 'ask', 'girlfriend', 'year', 'college', 'answer', 'sadly', 'truth', 'point', 'clearly', 'extremely', 'happy', 'conceal', 'happiness', 'have', 'girlfriend', 'meeting', 'actually', 'pursue', 'woman', 'kinda', 'weird', 'socially', 'ask', 'hang', 'bunch', 'time', 'time', 'face', 'feeling', 'rush', 'lovesick', '20', 'year', 'old', 'college', 'student', 'make', 'far', 'physical', 'affection', 'go', 'tell', 'misery', 'go', 'guess', 'fault', 'blame', 'feeling', 'explain', 'honestly', 'afraid', 'have', 'bf', 'time', 'father', 'forbid', 'legal', 'adult', 'live', 'college', 'dorm', 'know', 'weird', 'true', 'strict', 'catholic', 'household', 'thing', 'genuinely', 'hard', 'good', 'friend', 'think', 'k.', 'doctor', 'mean', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'trust', 'dorky', 'biochem', 'student', 'massive', 'crush', 'simply', 'academic', 'help', 'stroke', 'vanity', 'sound', 'outside', 'perspective', 'friend', 'correct', 'follow', 'feeling', 'girl', 'want', 'bad', 'honestly']"

I been with my boyfriend for about 3 months now. It’s been going pretty well and I feel like it’s something real with this guy. He’s perfect for me and it’s crazy. Everything is going great, but one thing...

The problem: He talks about his “high school girlfriend” A LOT. We’ll call her Katie*. (obv not her real name)

When we would go on dates his phone would blow up with her just ranting / venting to him about things or bringing up past relationship stuff and he would just say, “It’s Katie. She’s going through a lot of stuff right now” and brush it off to me like it’s nothing.

Also when I met his friends, he also mentioned that, “Oh, you have to meet Katie too, she’s my friend too.” I told him that made me super uncomfortable and he got pretty offended about it.

Anywho. He’s moving out of his childhood home and I’ve been helping him pack up his stuff and helping him clean, etc. (I only help out sometimes).

He texted me the other day saying he found some things from his ex. Like love letters and random stuff that she used to draw and write for him throughout their relationship in high school. (They were each other’s first love). I asked him if he was going to keep them and he said yeah. I was surprised because he was getting rid of a lot of other things because he said he didn’t have room for them but he seems to have boxes full of items from Katie.

I just think it’s interesting and I guess I’m just a little annoyed / paranoid about him keeping those things because they were from the past... I mean I can’t lie I do have some stuff from my first love but they are tucked away somewhere. I guess I just feel like he has unresolved feelings for her or something.

We did talk about this before and he just mentioned that he liked keeping things from her because she’s really important to him and all that jazz.

They broke up after high school in 2013 because he was moving to a college on the east coast and he didn’t want her following her or anything like that. 

But a few years later they met up and did a friends with benefits things. She ended it and they are still REALLY GOOD friends. (This was 3 years ago)

They don’t hang out much since she doesn’t live in his area anymore (she moved to a different state).

I mean I guess you’ll always have feelings for your first love I know that’s a big deal, but I don’t get why he has to keep every single little thing that she made for him, etc. (He still had the prom photos up in his bedroom while we’ve been dating.)

I’ve asked him about it and he just said the things are important to him and that Katie is important to him and he has assured me many times that they are now just friends.

I guess I’m just on the opposite end of things because I’m not friends with any of my exes, let alone my first love...

TLDR; Boyfriend still keeps things from his first love (high school girlfriend) and I feel insecure about it, should I break things off with him because of how I feel?

616,8jjibj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jjibj/my_girlfriend_and_i_are_on_a_break/,My girlfriend and I are on a break,"    My girlfriend decided three weeks ago that we needed to go on a break, and that we should use this time to “grow as individuals so we can become a better couple.” On the day the break began we set the groundwork for it, and she told me she still intended on a future (marriage eventually) and that she still was madly in love with me. We talked also of moving in and that this break was necessary not only for us to fix some issues (my self confidence) which had been hurting us, but also for her to fix things with her family due to recent stress caused by mine that left her feeling anxious. 
     Time passed, and i felt that she was checking in on me (ex: id go to a bar, and she would tweet how her friend and her were going there later that week) or things relevant to us. However i ignored these, and after two weeks passed i decided to reach out to see how she was feeling. 
    She denied that the posts were for me, and she now says that shes still really hurt by my lack of self confidence (Because i had been deterring her love because i felt I wasn’t good enough at the time) and that shes unsure of us, but she is “hopeful” and that she still needs time before we can talk. She said that it had only been two weeks and we still needed time to improve. I asked if she still loved me and she said yes, but was unsure of our future, and that she had alot going on (family related) and that we weren’t the top of her concerns. And that she needed to learn to love herself before she was ready for any relationship, and that she was focusing on herself still and for me to do the same. While i can say i have taken up working out again, and pushing harder in school to pass the time, and improve myself so that this time isn’t wasted, im confused as to her flip. This woman told me four weeks ago she wanted a lifetime with me and even gave me a promise ring only now to tell me she is unsure, but still loves me. I trust her, but am also hesitant as to what i should do. I do love her, and would love a lifetime with her, but also find that i dont want to be strung along, and want to know if sje is going to cut the tie with me. She still checks my stories on snapchat immediately, but other than that remains quite.I also kinda just wanted to air my feelings, so im sorry interwebs. 

Any and all advice is appreciated

We would hang out 1\-2 times per week and after just a few times of getting together, I saw chemistry. Our friendship escalated and we would continue to hang out and eventually had sex a few times.

Unfortunately, I am still extremely confused about where I stand in this relationship. She doesn't respond very well to my texts, a day or two late sometimes. Yet when we are at work together, we get along very well. We also have not hung out in a couple of weeks but she has finals going on in college so I will give her the benefit of the doubt.

I really do like her, but I try to play it cool. But all i truly want is to know how she feels about me. 

I have tried to talk about ""us"" the last time we where together, and it seemed like she didnt want to talk about it, and kind of brushed it off.

I really do not know what to do here. So the questions i have are

\-If a girl has had sex with you on multiple occasions, is there a good chance she has feelings for you?

\-What would you do in this situation?

\-How long would a girl typically play the hard to get game?

\-Should I flat out tell her my feelings for her?

My rebuttal is that I am trying to keep a human aspect about it. My friend has a point that some of the extra details could just serve as hurtful rather than informative, but I think it paints a fuller picture. Please let me know your thoughts:


Dear ___,


I assume you know who I am. I dated Ana for a few months when you guys were split up. I have been considering writing you for awhile now, but now I feel very compelled to. Ana does not have any clue that I am writing this to you, so you can take what I’ve got to say and consider how you want to deal with it. I’ve got a lot to tell you, and I think you might want to read all of it, even though it will surely hurt. One of the reasons that I’ve taken a long time to write you, is that I haven’t figured out how to say it all. I encourage you to read it all, but the long story short, is that Ana and I have been having sex fairly regularly for the last 10 months or so.


The reason I am telling you this is two fold. For one, I have tried to quit Ana several times. Even though she has jerked me and my emotions around a bunch, she still has somehow had power over me. I’ve convinced myself that she’s a good person, as she comes off as very thoughtful, but as time has gone on, I’m really doubting that assessment. Even though I realize this, I’m somewhat addicted to her, and when she starts texting me that she wants me, I pretty much always cave. Either two things will come from me telling you this. 1- you won’t tell her that you know this, and you will fix your sex life with her (I wouldn’t recommend, but won’t judge you if that’s what you do, since I know that you clearly love her very much) OR 2- you will confront her with this, she will know that I told you, and she will hate me and will leave me alone. Quite frankly, I don’t think that she deserves either of us. Again-I’m trying not to ramble here, so I’m going to go in more detail below. You can read it or not, but I’m coming clean with it all.
When Ana dumped me in January of last year, I basically stopped talking to her. I was pretty upset about it, but considering we weren’t even fighting or anything when she told me she wanted to break up, I had my suspicions that you had something to do with the breakup. I couldn’t prove it though, and I didn’t want to be a stalker ex and wanted to try to move on. I talked to her a couple of times in February before she led me on and then straight up ignored me when I texted her on valentines day. After that, I didn’t talk to her at all for 4 and a half months. I blocked her facebook, insta, anything that I was going to see her in that was going to set me back. I can’t say that I didn’t miss her, but I was moving forward.


At the end of June last year, Ana texted me with some sort of article about kayaking (since I’m a kayaker) with the typical “this made me think of you” kinda thing. We chatted a little, and then I asked her if she wanted to catch up. She brought over Chick-fil-a for me and we talked for a little bit. She didn’t mention anything about having a boyfriend at all. I didn’t ask, but considering we were telling each other about our last 4-5 months, I kinda figured she’d bring it up if you all were together. Since she didn’t, I assumed she was single again. In fact I didn’t think she would have even contacted me if she was in a relationship. After hanging out for a little, I made a move. She acted surprised, and she said she had to go and left. The next day she texted me saying that now she was thinking about it and that she did want to. I was leaving town for the weekend so I didn’t see her until I got back on Sunday night, but then she invited me over, and we had sex. July 2nd was when this all started.


I can spare you details about other encounters that we had over the next couple of months. It was more or less a booty call situation. I was on a real hot streak last summer, and honestly Ana was just one of several girls that I was seeing at the time. I was fine with that situation, because even though I really liked her before, I was still a little bitter with the way she ended our relationship the first time. I decided to play the field a bit and just keep our relationship sexual. After about 2.5-3 months of playing the field pretty hard, I kinda got tired of it, and I was pretty well over the original breakup. I approached Ana about trying a relationship again, but was surprised when she balked at the idea. She had seemed really into me again, and we were talking throughout the day nearly every day. It had seemed to kinda moved from a booty call to where we were talking again. After that, we kinda stopped talking for maybe a month or so. Then, one day in either late September or early October, she text me out of the blue wanting some “advice”. I actually found it, and am attaching screenshots of it. Sorry if it’s a little harsher than you wanted to see, but I think it’s important you see it. You’ll see in it, she brushed it aside when I asked her specifically if you guys were seeing each other again. It was sometime within the next couple of weeks that I got her to finally admit to me that you guys had been dating the entire time.


I kinda felt bad about it at first. I really felt sorry for you because she was cheating on you, but the way that Ana was framing it up, you were ignoring her sexually, and she was starved in that department. I’ve got no idea what the real situation was or has been like, I can only go on what she’s told me. In my mind, your relationship together was running its course anyways, and on top of that, I didn’t have a ton of sympathy for you specifically, considering you had interfered with my relationship with her the first time around. Even now with me telling you all this, it’s not so much that I’m doing this just for your benefit, but more so as a guy who after so long of this wants to be done with it, and can’t stand to see a woman doing another man like this. Anyways, I digress. Back to the story.


At this point, I was very much into Ana again. She really seemed to want me, and like I said above, I thought your days were numbered. It was at that point that I realized that you were offering her something that I was not- a commitment. When I had mentioned trying something again before, I was pretty non-committal about it. I was more suggesting we spend a little more time together outside of the bedroom and seeing if it might go somewhere. I told Ana that I wanted to be together, and she seemed into the idea, until I told her that the one condition was that she had to break if off with you completely. Cease contact. I knew that you had interfered before, and if I was going to dive into something with her, it was not going to be with emotional baggage coming along and tripping us up. She said that she wouldn’t do that, that you guys were too close and had too much history together. She said that she was “terrified” to lose you. After that, I was kind of offended, and my ego took a bit of a hit. I felt like I was clearly what she wanted and I was offering her more than you could, but she wouldn’t make the leap. I told her that we needed to end it then, and she agreed. Not sure if you remember the night, but I ran into you guys at the grocery store during that break. I just saw her and didn’t see you were with her until after I had walked away, but that was in the middle of maybe a 3 week break that we had stopped having sex. It was quite awkward for her and I walking past each other acting like nothing had been up.
Well, the break did not last, and at the end of October, she hit me up with some pretty suggestive messages. I was weak, as I pretty much always am with her. I’m pretty much addicted to the sex, and no matter how I try I eventually always cave to her. She came over and I told her that I wasn’t stoked about the situation still, with you all being together. I then told her if she wanted to keep doing this that my offer still stood, but she was going to have to cut things off with you completely. She thought about it and then told me that she would, but when I asked her about it a few days later, she said she couldn’t do it. She said that you’re the person that she’s thought that she’s going to eventually marry and have children with. I kinda thought that that’s fucked up considering she’s just accepting the fact that she’s going to cheat on the man that she plans to build a life with. We hooked up a few more times in November, but then at the end of the month, I actually met another girl that I was super into. During that time I was able to turn Ana down. Unfortunately the thing with the new girl didn’t last very long. As I got to know her better I wasn’t as into her as I thought. That lasted about 3 weeks, and by the end of it, Ana was telling me that she missed me and I thought that, again, she was changing her mind and wanted to move forward. Turns out it was more of the same.


Right before I left to fly home for Christmas, I asked Ana to come over because I needed to talk to her. She showed up with a present for me, which was super nice, but I had to tell her that it was over between her and I. I told her that I had given her plenty of time to make her mind up, and it was obviously not going to change. I wanted to leave this dysfunctional relationship in 2017. I told her I was blocking her phone number and all social media accounts so she couldn’t contact me and tempt me back into what we’d been doing. It was really difficult, but I did just that.
We didn’t talk at all for about 2 and a half weeks, then during the first week of January, she used the one way to contact me that I had forgotten to block: my work email. She told me that she had missed me so much and that she had decided that it was actually time to end it with you. I’ve got a picture of her at _____ on January 6th on my phone(to give you an idea of the timeframe). She told me that she had tried to break up with you the night before, but that you wouldn’t let her. Given all the difficulty she had had before, it didn’t surprise me, but I was convinced that it was for sure running its course and would be over in a matter of weeks. Ana and I hung out a ton in January and into February a bit. The weekend of January 19th, Ana went with me on a trip up to _______ for a concert. It really felt like we were together at that point, but apparently not. She clearly didn’t care what this was doing to either of us, as long as it was good for her. At some point in early February, I realized that nothing was changing, and this was going to go on for forever. I caved into her probably once every few weeks until early April, and we haven’t seen each other since then.


I’ve gotten pretty fed up with her and I no longer think she is a good person. I think that even though she can come off as very thoughtful and caring, she is actually a very selfish person. She doesn’t care what she does to either of our emotions-the two men in the world that care the most about hers. I don’t think it’s right that she can get exactly what she wants while we are left out to dry. I honestly hope that you choose the path of showing her this or telling her that I told you and leaving her high and dry for once. I’m fine with her hating me and never wanting to talk to me again. As I said to start the email, I’m not telling her that I told you this, and I’m not going to tell you how to live your life or make your decisions, but I do want to make sure that you know what is up. If you decide to swallow hard on this and try to fix that relationship, best of luck to you. Please fix it and don’t even let her want to stray. Even if I found the strength to resist her, or you prevented her from having a chance to see me, chances are, she will just find another guy if the problems aren’t fixed. I am sorry you had to find out like this, but it’s better you know now rather than when you’re married and have children. Best of luck.

We dated for nearly four years. My ex had been unblocking and blocking me on Instagram for like almost two months and I wasn’t sure why. So Saturday night I couldn’t take it anymore and I messaged him. 

To my surprise, he actually responded. All I said was hi and was kept the conversation going. We asks how we’ve both been, about what Pittsburgh is like for him, jobs, and then we talked about personal issues like family and friendships. We then started talking about a bunch of random shit and we were joking around. It was like nothing had ever changed. Then I asked him why he unblocked and blocked me a million times. 

He told me he did that because he felt horrible about what happened between us and wanted to reach or and apologize numerous times, but he wasn’t able to bring himself to do it because he thought I hated him because of how bad our recent falling out was. He apologized and I told him I wish he had done it sooner and he responded with me too. 

He apologized again and said he was happy we cleared up some things. I told him I was positive that he hated me but I was glad we are able to talk now. This was at 3am we talked all day since the morning and he had fallen asleep and soon I did too. I woke up around 1pm and he didn’t respond but left my message on seen. Idk when he saw it because Instagram doesn’t give you that. I thought maybe he’s at work or he’s with his friends or just genuinely busy. It’ll soon be almost 24 hours since we talked and now I’m anxious and worried. I didn’t want to get my hopes up but I’m just confused. I’m not sure if he is intentionally ignoring me or has truly been busy all day. He was never one to really use social media in the first place.

I told him numerous times throughout our conversation that if I was making him uncomfortable or if he just didn’t want to talk, we didn’t have to. He reassured me that he really wanted to talk to me and I shouldn’t worry about it.

I want to send him another message but I don’t want to seem super annoying and pushy since we just started talking again. I’m thinking I’ll give him till tomorrow when I wake up and if he doesn’t respond then...I’m not sure? Maybe block him again? 

I don’t want a relationship with him because that doesn’t sound very realistic at this point or in the future, but who knows. I am not holding onto hope of that idea. What I wanted to gain out of this was being friends and maybe even occasionally talking from time to time. We were close friends for a few years before we dated.

He said he wants to propose, but he is waiting for the right time when he is in a better place financially. The problem is I feel he could have been doing more to make extra money, like work on the weekends or pick up extra night shifts, but he always finds excuses for why he can't make more money. He will say he is so embarrassed about borrowing money, but I don't believe it because someone who was truly embarrassed wouldn't ask for money in the first place, they would find another way.

I've been dating this girl (20F) for 2 months (march 20th, 2018 our anniversary) and have been talking to her since new years day (4 months total). she's kind, sweet, caring, supportive, pretty, has nice features, has a great family and the most welcoming friend group I've ever come across, but i don't feel like I'm all there with her. sometimes i get annoyed by certain things she says and sometimes i can tell i feel somewhat distant with her. she would tell me a story about a friend of hers and i would totally forget what she had talked about after the story was over and feel really bad because i don't feel like I'm as engaged as i should be. 
She's had problems in the past with people groping her and touching her inappropriately and is clearly scared of trying anything sexual given her history. at first it made perfect sense to me why she would, but now i feel like theres more to it that she's not telling me and still refuses anything sexual between us. it annoys me that we can't take that step together by now but i understand her reasoning. 
the main problem is, i think that she's everything I've wanted in a relationship and i don't see any concrete reason to dump her, because i do feel lucky to be with her, but i just don't feel the spark i felt on our first date and like I've had in the past with other girls. i feel like I'm leading her on and i feel like if i dumped her it would absolutely crush her. her and her family are going through some rough times medically and she and i are both struggling through college and i feel like i am more of an impact on her than she is on me and i know thats not fair to her. i just don't know if i should wait to see if things get better between us or if i should pull the plug. THE ABSOLUTE last thing i would want to do is wait to have sex with her and then decide its not right for me to stay in this relationship. 
Overall, there is no concrete reason for me to leave because she's everything I've ever asked for from a relationship, but i just feel like I'm not as invested as i should be yet and i don't want to get rid of something good if it can change in the future, but i also don't want to keep waiting for it to get better if I'm not totally satisfied with what i have.

We met at the beginning of freshman year and have been in the same friend group ever since, but never have been super close.  Over the last year I’ve noticed more in her eyes, hair, smile and even how she smells.  Looking back on our friendship I wonder if she wanted more from me.  The way she would look at me and make small hints make me fairly certain that she liked me.  I feel bad that I couldn’t be who she wanted me to be, I was going through some mental health issues and like to push people away during episodes like that.  Over the past 6 months I think my feelings have grown but I haven’t been able to figure out how she feels.  I’ve been trying to just get to know her better, just as a friend.  However she constantly brings up other guys and it is infuriating.  Guys who she likes but doesn’t really talk to anymore, want to take her on a date, are cute etc.  We aren’t close enough where I feel comfortable asking why she does it, and I’m not sure if it’s trying to make me jealous or if it’s meant to show how she can move on and trying to make me feel bad for not trying to be with her when I had what felt like my chance.  Either way it hurts and it happens enough to feel like a pattern.  I want to have a relationship that doesn’t feel this strange.  I wish it would be romantic, but I just don’t know how to get there.

(28f) recently broke up with my boyfriend (40m). We were together for about a year, doing the whole long distance thing.

He'd apologize and I would forgive him and we would go on our merry way. This happened multiple times. About 2 weeks ago, he ghost me again. I gave it a week and being frustrated I broke up with him over a text. Haven't heard from him yet, but he always views my snap stories.

Let's call him Joe. So, I really thought that Joe and I were going to date but it turned out to be more of a friends with benefits type of deal. We talked very sporadically for about five months before hooking up for the first time. It was a really low key kind of thing because it turned out he had a psycho ex...anyways....In February, I started talking to this guy that we'll call Dan. I really, really liked Dan but things just fizzled out between us around the end of March. Once we stopped talking, Joe hit me up again and I hooked up with him and have about four times since. I always knew that Joe and Dan were acquaintances, but I didn't realize how close they were until after I started sleeping with Joe again. While neither of them talked about each other, they kept appearing in each other's snap stories and facebook tags, and from asking around they seem to be very close friends. Joe is 24 and Dan is 26, and I'm only 21...I really don't know how male friendships go at that age. About three weeks ago I got tired of being someone's booty call so I cut things off with Joe. I'm looking for a relationship, not a hook up. Dan and I have been slowly talking again and I can see things going somewhere with him. My friends are convinced it won't work out because of my ""relationship"" with his best friend. I have no proof or clue, but I'm sure they've talked about me and realize that they have me in common. I don't really want to bring it up, because it doesn't seem relevant at this point, since we're only talking casually. I would never have slept with them at the same time, nor would I ever sleep with Joe while Dan and I are together. I'm just taking things slow with Dan at the moment, but I don't want to waste my time waiting around for him if he's not going to take me seriously because of this. I guess my main question for everybody is, has it ever been an issue in your relationship if your S/O has slept with someone you are friends with in the past? I've looked for advice and have only come across people cheating with their S/Os best friend which I did not nor would I ever do.

Terrified of making the wrong choice.,"I've been wondering if my SO \[35M\] and I \[27F\] are good for each other for more than half of our relationship. Any time I think I'm ready to end it and have my answer, I think about all the fun things we do together and all the good traits about him and all the things I'm going to miss like crazy and I just can't bring myself to do it. It's come to a point that I wake up feeling absolutely miserable every day. I don't feel connected to him anymore but I feel that is my own fault for building up a wall between us. I sat at dinner a few nights ago racking my brain trying to think of a conversation but just didn't have the energy.. I just couldn't be bothered even trying to talk to him.. He's such a good guy and treats me well and he deserves the best but I just struggle so much to give it to him. I have no motivation and just feel depressed and like I've given up. I know things used to be good between us but then I have just gotten so stressed and frustrated with him and he's made so many stupid decisions that i feel like i've lost respect for him. I'm embarrassed by him at times because of choices he makes and things he says... Yet i'm terrified that if I break things off i'm going to be an absolute inconsolable wreck of a person that will be begging at his feet for him to take me back. There's just no way that I can see myself meeting somebody who treats me better and is so sweet and caring like him. I don't think i could ever find somebody who loves me as much as he does. I feel like i'm stuck in this stupid limbo that is making me miserable. I can't put my all into the relationship because I am just not convinced it's going to work and I don't know how to get the respect back that I lost for him.. Or get rid of left over resentment towards him that I feel is still lingering.. I miss him when I'm not with him but when I am with him I generally want to lay in bed and do nothing. Which makes me feel like shit. I smoke weed relentlessly just so I can ignore the emptiness that I feel inside and weed is something that I only started when I got with him... I don't want to smoke weed anymore... it makes me numb and makes me not want to leave the house.. ever.. but when i'm with him I crave it and feel like I need it. We quit for a few weeks before... I felt amazing... he did too.. but then he picked it up again immediately. I tried to go as long as I could but with him smoking all day everyday I just couldn't resist it after awhile... once every now and then turned into a few bowls a day again pretty quick. We have a shitty yet affordable apartment and 2 adorable cats together which we could not keep if we split up and that breaks my heart. They are rescues and I don't want them going back to a shelter.. they don't deserve that.. But honestly I wont even be able to stay in the country if we split up. I wont have a home, ill have to crash on couches until I figure out where I can go \(rentals are very few and far between in the resort I live in and cost an arm leg and kidney in rent\). I can't keep the cats living that lifestyle... He is allergic to them and will also be going off traveling if we split. Also with his shocking memory problems I'd be terrified leaving them with just him to care for them. I am constantly wondering about other guys and whether I'd be happier if I was single or dating someone else.. and during a short break between SO and myself.. I kissed another guy and it was the most excitement I had felt in a very long time... \(Things in the bedroom with SO have been severely lacking... I am never in the mood anymore...\) I don't know if all my negative feelings are due to being stuck in limbo or are due to the fact that this relationship is slowly suffocating me. I don't know if it's possible to get this relationship back on track.. A part of me would like it to.. Yet the thought of marrying him is just... hard to imagine. I don't see him standing there with me at the alter, I don't see us sharing kids together... I see those things in my head with some imaginary perfect guy who doesn't exist... And still the thought of a future without current SO still is heartbreaking! What's wrong with me?! 

I feel like whatever decision I make, I will regret. Being with him is the best relationship I've ever had and I feel like I'm going to hate myself forever if I end it. Yet I'm miserable and hate myself right now too and he just drives me up the wall so often. And there are things about his personality that I just struggle so much with... We never laugh together anymore... I just don't find things funny that he finds funny... 

How do I know I wont feel this way with every person I date? I broke things off with the last guy after he cheated on me, took me for granted and treated me like shit. A guy that I knew would never be ""forever"" yet that break up was brutal. I was suicidal, I was begging for him back. I let him play me and use me for 8 months, crushing me over and over and over again during this time and eventually hurting me so badly that I left the country and still haven't fully recovered 3 years later. If that's how the last break up went then this one is going to be mega\-fucked. If I don't fight through it this time and find a way to make things work, maybe I never will find happiness...

I am going through one of the hardest times in my life as I attempt to figure out what to do with my relationship.  My fiance and I met 4 years ago and instantly connected.  At the time, I was dating someone else, but wound up breaking off that engagement to start dating my fiance.  It was particularly ugly at first as there was some gray area as to when one relationship ended and another began, and sadly, since then my fiance has had some minor trust issues with me.   My fiance currently lives with me, but I do travel a lot for work, so I am not home as often as I would like.  I do love being around her, and spending time with her, although sometimes I do wonder if we have enough in common.  She is Colombian and I am American clearly and we come from very different backgrounds, but we do have a good time together.  Lately though we have been fighting a bit and she has become a bit jealous.  She figured out how to track my location on my phone and often logs in and checks to see if I have been where I am.

Besides the jealousy, I also worry a bit about her age.  She is already 31 years old and I do know she would like to have kids sooner rather than later, but I do not think I will be ready for that for at least 6\-7 years.  I worry about her looks significantly declining at that level as well.   She also has almost no money other than what I provide for her and while my attorneys have written up a fairly iron\-clad prenup; i do worry about how much she would get if we stay married for a significant amount of time.  

Throughout the relationship I have cheated, but it has never been an emotional thing.  It has always been while traveling and never with anyone serious.  One girl I was with did get pregnant and messaged my fiance about it, but I was able to pay her and pay for her to have an abortion and she wound up ghosting.  My fiance is very attractive right now, but she isn't exactly my type.  Again, I worry about how she will age being that she is already 31, and I do worry about her insane jealousy and how that might effect things in the future and if I will always be able to stay ahead of her and if she will just stop trying to catch me cheating.  

I just dont know what to do.  I dont want to give up on her.  I am hoping that things will get better.  I just hate the fighting and my gut is telling me not to go forward with this.  She keeps telling me that she is getting better at trusting me, but do people ever change that much? Also is it true that as you age your taste in women ages as well.  That horrifies me as well.

I’ve made this account for two reason. One to rant and vent as I know my relationship is coming to an end... second to look at dog pictures to keep my mind off this failing relationship. My boyfriend and I have been living together for about a year. (We are both 23) Our sex life has gone to shit and we don’t even talk anymore. Looking at the relationship now I can see that he never really respected me because he would always blow me off to do other things and we barely talked but I loved him anyway. Today I found a condom wrapper under our bed. We don’t use condoms and honestly I’m heart broken because I’ve really loved him but now it’s clear that he doesn’t love me.
How should I end things with him? I’ve already left and lied and said my mom needed me for the night. I couldn’t stand to be in the same house with him.

Edit: I confronted him about it and he did cheat on me. I kicked him out of the apartment and we will no longer be talking.","['find', 'condom', 'wrapper', 'bed', 'use', 'condom', 'hello', 'reddit', 'account', 'reason', 'rant', 'vent', 'know', 'relationship', 'come', 'end', 'second', 'look', 'dog', 'picture', 'mind', 'fail', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'live', 'year', '23', 'sex', 'life', 'go', 'shit', 'talk', 'anymore', 'look', 'relationship', 'respect', 'blow', 'thing', 'barely', 'talk', 'love', 'today', 'find', 'condom', 'wrapper', 'bed', 'use', 'condom', 'honestly', 'heart', 'break', 'love', 'clear', 'love', 'end', 'thing', 'leave', 'lie', 'say', 'mom', 'need', 'night', 'stand', 'house', 'edit', 'confront', 'cheat', 'kick', 'apartment', 'longer', 'talk']"

To preface, my bf and I have been dating for about 6 months, give or take. Things have been great so far, I really saw a future with him. He lives in a city about an hour by car from me and we see each other usually about 3-4 times a week. I am a student and I recently started renting a basement apartment, with the knowledge that he would be moving in with me in August (his old lease is not up until August). This is important because the only reason I began renting this place was because he was supposed to move in and help pay the rent, which I cannot afford by myself. My parents are currently helping me pay the rent because I cannot afford the full $1000 a month being a student.

This all started today because I like to go on my bf's phone. I was not worried about him cheating or anything like that, I just like to go on his instagram and facebook feeds and look at memes, and he does not care. He never once raised concern about me going on his phone. I ended up in his emails today, looking to get rid of the notification saying he had two unread emails. Unfortunately for me, one of those emails was a Craigslist reply, he basically replied to an ad on there and said ""my girlfriend and I want to swap videos with you! Here is a short video of us, hope to hear back from you"" with a video clip attached. Upon confronting him I find out he sent one of our private sex videos to a random person on Craigslist. Luckily neither of our faces were in it. He starts crying saying it was a huge mistake and he regretted it so much. I proceed to ask if he did anything else like that, worried he might have sent more videos out. He denied it, so I asked to see his phone. When I searched ""craigslist"" into his email search bar, at least 10 emails popped up, he grabbed his phone and BEGGED me not to look. Months before we started dating, a week before we started dating, TWO WEEKS AGO, he has been replying to sexual ads on Craigslist. I took him on a nice trip for his birthday a couple weeks ago. Literally 2 days after we got back he was emailing people on Craigslist.

And to get even weirder, he's claiming he is bi in some of these, saying he loves to suck dick, I think he replied to a transgendered persons ad? Not once has he told me that. I went into the relationship thinking he was straight (and it wouldn't bother me if he was bi, I would have liked to know though). And even in other emails to other people he's saying he's straight. There is no indication that he ever went to meet these people. He emails them once, then thats it, he doesn't reply anymore. I believe he just messaged them to get off and then never messaged them again. I am still going to get an STD check though.

Basically he's been doing this since before we even started dating and just didn't stop when we became official. He completely broke down crying and literally begging on his knees that he was sorry and he wants a second chance, he was so upset he threw up. He's due to move in in like less than 3 months, and I cannot afford this place by myself, and I cant get out of it because I already gave them a years worth of predated cheques. My parents cannot afford to help me for a whole year, they were nice enough just to help for the few months.

I feel like I really messed up. I trusted this guy, and started to plan my future with him and now I feel betrayed and lost. I don't know how I would begin to forgive him or trust him again.

I recently broke off an engagement with an with a woman that I was with for roughly 4 and a half years.

I moved from the east coast (where I am from) to a new city in the western states about five years ago. Met a girl very quickly, fell in love and got engaged about 6 months ago. It became apparent to me shortly after the engagement that I had been far too optimistic & that our relationship was not built to last, so I ended things at the end of March.

Since then, I received a job offer and have decided to move back East.

I don’t know how to tell her. We don’t communicate except for when absolutely necessary, but I know she still holds a bit of hope that things will work out.

Friends have suggested everything from a private conversation to a hand written letter. I still care for her deeply as a person. She has a good heart. 

What are your suggestions for how I should break the news? It seems right that I should do things in person, but things tend to get so emotionally volatile. Thoughts?

TLDR: I’m moving back to the East Coast and don’t know how to tell my freshly separated ex-fiancé.

Get ready for a ride. 
We’re both girls in our 20s. I just came out and she’s never had to come out, she’s just always gone with whatever and no one has questioned anything. 
We have been seeing each other for 2 years. I used to work at a coffee stand with a friend of her’s so I’d see her often enough. She started coming around more more when she knew it was just me. I didn’t think she thought I would be into her and figured she liked to flirt like some girls do. I felt like throwing up every time she’d show up. At one point she came in to invite my coworker friend of hers to a party and passively said I could come along. Long story short we send most of the party in the laundry room making out. I was grabbing at her clothes but she laughed and didn’t let me go any farther saying that she liked me too much to fuck and never hear from me again. 
I left embarrassed before I could get her number but I figured she’d come to the coffee shop to give it to me in person. I almost give up after being there for hours when a flower delivery comes and the card is just her number. The first of many over the top events. We started talking and going on dates soon after. And then kissing, to touching, to passionate fucking. Out of  everyone she’s still who I am most compatible with especially sexually. She’s always made it feel so easy and safe since I’d never been to a woman before this mess. 
From the start she made it very clear that this would not be in a relationship, and even encouraged me to see people outside of our arrangement. She said that she just wasn’t ready for one. She was dealing with a lot of personal stuff emotionally and didn’t want to be exclusive since it would mean I would sacrifice my potential of meeting someone much better. I took it as a green light to mess around with girls. Catch up for lost time I guess. She’s never minded and even introduced me to someone I had a brief thing with.
However. The whole time we have been together she would do these extravagant things. Like a surprise birthday first class trip to Paris to eat at restaurants she had booked months in advance, for Christmas she had custom earrings made to match my grandmas hand me down bracelet, or we spent a week at a beach house together because she missed me, or send me a bouquet of roses to my work when she misses me. She has a few jobs and a scholarship that allows her to do these things but id still say that most of her extra cash must come to me. 
We do all the things I think couples are suppose to do. PDA, gifts, dates, calls me pretty or beautiful like  50 times a day but even when we say we’re together the Clarification of “not exclusively” is there. 
Our arrangement worked out so well until now. She’s the least jealous and possessive person which kind of bums me out. I could go have dates or one night stands and she’d be there in the morning to pick me up and make me breakfast, happy and asking if I had a good time. 
The more I want to settle down it’s with her. And the more she hears that the more she suggests putting us on hold and pushes me to find others people because she can’t really be what I am asking. 
I know that is fair for her to feel end and I want to be angry but all I feel instead is sadness and fear I could lose a friend on top of a lover. I’m not sure what I’m asking.

So the title isn't the greatest but I'm really crappy at summaries.

My boyfriend recently started working from home - I can't be too detailed about the job but he's an entrepreneur of sorts and spends the bulk of his time talking/pitching/etc. It's neat, I suppose. It turned into something he did in his spare time to something he did for 8 hours to literally 12+ hours a day. It turned into 5 days a week to 6 days a week and now 7 days a week. It's great that he's committing himself to something and I can appreciate that, except it's totally cliche but it feels like he has 0 time for me and when he does it just pisses me off.

This morning we talked briefly and I was like, obsessed with hyenas. I'm not joking, I don't know what happened but I fell into Wikipedia and I love hyenas. I was telling him about it because I was excited and he goes, ""I don't care about that as much as you do, not even a little. I have to start working now anyway."" If you can, imagine that it was said with humor. I was there and I didn't find the humor in it but I could tell they were trying to be humorous yet they obviously meant what they said.  I brought it up and they said, ""It was obviously a joke!"" and then I just asked, ""Oh, so you didn't mean you were disinterested and wanted me to be quiet?"" and then they were just like, ""Well....."" They apologized but it didn't really help, tbh. Also, note, they never started working until 3 hours later. 

Additionally, whenever they are actually working, they can't give me the time of day unless it's to ask me to make them coffee or they're getting up to go to the bathroom and they want to say something sweet but I'm kinda just like, ""that's nice, go pee or whatever."" I tap their shoulder, they shake their head or flat out ignore me.

All his interactions with me are either in-between him doing something else, asking me to make him coffee, asking me to make him food, asking me to help him with this little laptop and even then, when he asked me to do that, as soon as he was done asking and I was trying to talk to him, he said he had to go now so that was that.

I know he's doing something important but really, I just don't care to listen to him even talk about it, which he spends every chance doing so. I don't really know what to do. How do you encroach on a subject that's obviously not going to go well because complaining might imply I don't care about the thing they're focusing on?

And I don't even recognize if I'm just being picky.","['boyfriend', '24_m', 'bother', '21_f', 'sure', 'irritable', 'hiya', 'title', 'great', 'crappy', 'summary', 'boyfriend', 'recently', 'start', 'work', 'home', 'detailed', 'job', 'entrepreneur', 'sort', 'spend', 'bulk', 'time', 'talk', 'pitching', 'etc', 'neat', 'suppose', 'turn', 'spare', 'time', '8', 'hour', 'literally', '12', 'hour', 'day', 'turn', '5', 'day', 'week', '6', 'day', 'week', '7', 'day', 'week', 'great', 'commit', 'appreciate', 'totally', 'cliche', 'feel', 'like', '0', 'time', 'piss', 'morning', 'talk', 'briefly', 'like', 'obsess', 'hyenas', 'joke', 'know', 'happen', 'fall', 'wikipedia', 'love', 'hyenas', 'tell', 'excited', 'go', 'care', 'little', 'start', 'work', 'imagine', 'say', 'humor', 'find', 'humor', 'tell', 'try', 'humorous', 'obviously', 'mean', 'say', 'bring', 'say', 'obviously', 'joke', 'ask', 'oh', 'mean', 'disintereste', 'want', 'quiet', 'like', 'apologize', 'help', 'tbh', 'note', 'start', 'work', '3', 'hour', 'later', 'additionally', 'actually', 'work', 'time', 'day', 'ask', 'coffee', 'get', 'bathroom', 'want', 'sweet', 'kinda', 'like', 'nice', 'pee', 'tap', 'shoulder', 'shake', 'head', 'flat', 'ignore', 'interaction', 'ask', 'coffee', 'ask', 'food', 'ask', 'help', 'little', 'laptop', 'ask', 'soon', 'ask', 'try', 'talk', 'say', 'know', 'important', 'care', 'listen', 'talk', 'spend', 'chance', 'know', 'encroach', 'subject', 'obviously', 'go', 'complaining', 'imply', 'care', 'thing', 'focus', 'recognize', 'picky']"

In that time she's been waiting on her papers to move to the US. I've  put my life on hold so I could go with her but it's been 2 years and nothing. 




She refuses to press the issue in case it messes up her case (basically she has been approved but is awaiting the official letter) so she won't contact the lawyer or anyone involved.



I'm really at my wits end. I love her more than anything but it's been 2 years of nothing.  I haven't gone back to college or work because it's always  ""we'll get it soon, any day now"" and it's been nothing but a drain on resources, for food and bills and everything else. 




I just don't know what to do. When we moved into our current place she said  just give it a month, things will work out. It's been three months and nothing. All the while the money I had saved gets lower and I feel like my mental health is getting worse and worse. I'm just fed up.




I spoke with her and she seemed a bit upset but immediately went back to scrolling on Facebook.  It's like she doesn't care and I know she is fed up too, just unwilling to do anything about it now matter how much I push her.

639,8ji1v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ji1v0/i_19m_am_worried_i_am_rebounding_too_quickly_and/,I (19M) am worried I am rebounding too quickly and with the wrong person (19F). Am I leading her on and how do I let her down easily?,"Throwaway because everyone involved has Reddit accounts.

Some backstory, I just got out of my first ever relationship of almost 3 years with my ex-gf (17F) when she started cheating on me with my best friend (19M). It has been a shitty situation all around and I took it really hard when I found out she didn't love me anymore, but the abuse throughout the relationship was obvious and I am definitely better off now. In my grief, I transitioned from an absolute goody-two shoes to a complete deviant, which has been a great time all told; I feel like I am finally enjoying college.

Now, when my ex-gf cheated on me with my best friend, I started talking to one of the girls, I'll call her Ivy, he tried to get with before he pursued my ex. I had a very slight prior friendship with her due to knowing her from a few classes and projects. I was pretty sad and I talked to her a lot about how I was feeling and she was super supportive to me in a way that was very comforting. Ivy and I got along very well from the get go and talked pretty much everyday, I always assumed that she didn't have a thing for me because she was always talking to me about this boy that she liked a lot but was giving her trouble, calling me bro, the usual friend zone stuff, I was more than okay with this because I valued her a ton as a friend.

Fast forward about 2 weeks and I get invited to a friends (20F) birthday party which was essentially a college house party. My friends and I arrive and I do a few shots and smoke a ton right away so I was gone within about 20 minutes of being there. To my surprise, because I knew for a fact she wasn't invited, Ivy arrives. I was pretty shocked but I was like whatever its cool let the party rage on. Then the birthday girl, who knows Ivy, pulls me aside and tells me that I need to ask Ivy out because she likes me. I remember saying something like, ""What is this middle school bullshit."" but I also was like ""cool thanks for the info."" Long story short I approach her and what my friend told me was true. Ivy wasn't drunk at all, which is important to remember I think, but she confessed all of her pent up feelings for me and I kinda just went along with it because she was touching me and it felt good in the moment. We made out until the party ended and my friends pried me out to make sure that we didn't have sex because, ironically enough, I told them before the party that I didn't want to do anything I'd regret. 

Ivy and I didn't talk to each other or about it for a few days before I finally cracked because it was stressing me out a lot. I told her I really would rather forget about it because it was out of character for me and I didn't really remember that much.

Here is where things get kinda interesting. Apparently at the party, I told Ivy I'd take her on a date because I think she's cool and she deserves it because she has not had a lot of luck with dating. So end of the semester comes by and she invites me and some friends over to her dorm to just drink and celebrate making it through the semester. Me, looking for a good time, says absolutely, I'll see you there. At the party, Ivy and I were vibing pretty well but then the liquor hit me all at once and I was down for the count. 

I remember coming back to a few hours later and I was in her bed and she was sitting up on the other side waiting for me to wake up. I thanked her for taking care of me and everything and then we got into this conversation about how we both know we have been beating around the bush and we should just be honest with each other. She, again, confessed all of her feelings for me and I told her how I honestly felt. I told her I really really like talking to her and hanging out with her and that she is a cool person. This led to us having hours of oral sex until the sun came up, like I had never felt so insane. At this point the alcohol had worn off and I started feeling a lot of regret I guess is the way to put it.

Alright that is the end of all of the backstory. Here is the present situation. Me and my ex have been broken up for over a month and I am pretty much over it, I don't anguish daily like I used to, however I definitely have a lot of hangups that are keeping me down. I don't know how to explain it but I feel like I have a lot of holes in me that I usually just cover up with smoking weed to be honest. I think I am not ready for a relationship yet because of this. Now with Ivy, I really do genuinely like her for who she is and I love talking to her. I feel super shallow for this but I am realizing that I am not attracted to her even in the slightest. Like if me and her were to date, I know for a fact that I would never be able to get passed the fact that I don't find her attractive. I don't want to do that to myself I guess. Me and her are going to talk about what we are tonight and I am super anxious because I can't keep lying to her. I really want to tell her that I am really only interested in our friendship but I don't know how to do it at this point. I still could take her on a date or whatever but I just don't want to waste either of our times. I just don't get the kind of butterflies or anything I usually would If I was actually interested in somebody. I'm a super polite guy so It is going to kill me to see her have her hopes killed because I know she is super excited about all of this. How do I let her down easy I guess?

tl;dr: After my girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me I started talking to a girl who I enjoy the company of a lot and after several parties where we ended up ""hooking up"" things are starting to look more serious but I am realizing that I am not at all attracted to her at all and I want to let her down as nicely as possible.","['19_m', 'worried', 'rebound', 'quickly', 'wrong', 'person', '19_f', 'lead', 'let', 'easily', 'throwaway', 'involve', 'reddit', 'account', 'backstory', 'get', 'relationship', '3', 'year', 'ex', 'gf', '17_f', 'start', 'cheat', 'good', 'friend', '19_m', 'shitty', 'situation', 'take', 'hard', 'find', 'love', 'anymore', 'abuse', 'relationship', 'obvious', 'definitely', 'well', 'grief', 'transition', 'absolute', 'goody', 'shoe', 'complete', 'deviant', 'great', 'time', 'tell', 'feel', 'like', 'finally', 'enjoy', 'college', 'ex', 'gf', 'cheat', 'good', 'friend', 'start', 'talk', 'girl', 'ivy', 'try', 'pursue', 'ex', 'slight', 'prior', 'friendship', 'know', 'class', 'project', 'pretty', 'sad', 'talk', 'lot', 'feel', 'super', 'supportive', 'way', 'comforting', 'ivy', 'get', 'talk', 'pretty', 'everyday', 'assume', 'thing', 'talk', 'boy', 'like', 'lot', 'give', 'trouble', 'call', 'bro', 'usual', 'friend', 'zone', 'stuff', 'okay', 'value', 'ton', 'friend', 'fast', 'forward', '2', 'week', 'invite', 'friend', '20_f', 'birthday', 'party', 'essentially', 'college', 'house', 'party', 'friend', 'arrive', 'shot', 'smoke', 'ton', 'right', 'away', 'go', '20', 'minute', 'surprise', 'know', 'fact', 'invite', 'ivy', 'arrive', 'pretty', 'shocked', 'like', 'cool', 'let', 'party', 'rage', 'birthday', 'girl', 'know', 'ivy', 'pull', 'aside', 'tell', 'need', 'ask', 'ivy', 'like', 'remember', 'say', 'like', 'middle', 'school', 'bullshit', 'like', 'cool', 'thank', 'info', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'approach', 'friend', 'tell', 'true', 'ivy', 'drunk', 'important', 'remember', 'think', 'confess', 'pen', 'feeling', 'kinda', 'go', 'touch', 'feel', 'good', 'moment', 'party', 'end', 'friend', 'pry', 'sure', 'sex', 'ironically', 'tell', 'party', 'want', 'regret', 'ivy', 'talk', 'day', 'finally', 'crack', 'stress', 'lot', 'tell', 'forget', 'character', 'remember', 'thing', 'kinda', 'interesting', 'apparently', 'party', 'tell', 'ivy', 'date', 'think', 'cool', 'deserve', 'lot', 'luck', 'dating', 'end', 'semester', 'come', 'invite', 'friend', 'dorm', 'drink', 'celebrate', 'make', 'semester', 'look', 'good', 'time', 'say', 'absolutely', 'party', 'ivy', 'vibe', 'pretty', 'liquor', 'hit', 'count', 'remember', 'come', 'hour', 'later', 'bed', 'sit', 'wait', 'wake', 'thank', 'take', 'care', 'get', 'conversation', 'know', 'beat', 'bush', 'honest', 'confess', 'feeling', 'tell', 'honestly', 'feel', 'tell', 'like', 'talk', 'hang', 'cool', 'person', 'lead', 'have', 'hour', 'oral', 'sex', 'sun', 'come', 'like', 'feel', 'insane', 'point', 'alcohol', 'wear', 'start', 'feel', 'lot', 'regret', 'guess', 'way', 'alright', 'end', 'backstory', 'present', 'situation', 'ex', 'break', 'month', 'pretty', 'anguish', 'daily', 'like', 'definitely', 'lot', 'hangup', 'keep', 'know', 'explain', 'feel', 'like', 'lot', 'hole', 'usually', 'cover', 'smoking', 'weed', 'honest', 'think', 'ready', 'relationship', 'ivy', 'genuinely', 'like', 'love', 'talk', 'feel', 'super', 'shallow', 'realize', 'attract', 'slight', 'like', 'date', 'know', 'fact', 'able', 'pass', 'fact', 'find', 'attractive', 'want', 'guess', 'go', 'talk', 'tonight', 'super', 'anxious', 'lie', 'want', 'tell', 'interested', 'friendship', 'know', 'point', 'date', 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'kind', 'butterfly', 'usually', 'actually', 'interested', 'somebody', 'super', 'polite', 'guy', 'go', 'kill', 'hope', 'kill', 'know', 'super', 'excited', 'let', 'easy', 'guess', 'tl;dr', 'girlfriend', '3', 'year', 'cheat', 'start', 'talk', 'girl', 'enjoy', 'company', 'lot', 'party', 'end', 'hook', 'thing', 'start', 'look', 'realize', 'attract', 'want', 'let', 'nicely', 'possible']"

She’s called a couple of times this evening, it’s nearly 2am and I was tired so not really sure about getting over to her house at this time, especially as the only way to get there is by taxi and I’ve got no money to get there and there’s no public transport at this time of night and it’s at such short notice.  

She informed me halfway through the conversation that she’d brought some random guy \(apparently a mutual friend of someone she’s been out with tonight\) back to her house who’s staying in the spare room and intermittently asking to have a cigarette, an extra pillow/excuse to have sex with her.  She even said he’s been trying to get laid all night with her.  I’m worried about her as well as extremely hurt by this.  She’s a very attractive woman too and often toys with people in this manner as an ego boost from what I can tell.  She’s also, while drunk and borderline psychotic, claimed to be seeing other people but tells me these claims were just pathetic attempts to make me jealous and are in no way true \- which I’ve chosen to believe and which, in all honesty, I find unlikely and I don’t feel foolish for believing her.

Now she’s an alcoholic essentially. I’m accepting up to a point as I’ve got my own issues with addiction \(to say the least\). I believe that if you love someone you can love them thick or thin, and when I’ve been in a bad space, that acceptance is something I felt I really needed and could help me get out of that horrible place. 

Anyway, I’ve been clean from crack and meth \(meth being my primary addiction\) for a couple of months now after yet another psychotic break and yet another hospitalization.  I’m not drinking either.  Anyway, while i’m not smashing up crack dens psychotic and accusing pimps of taking over my apartment to use as a whore house \(I don’t know if there’s a more pc term for that as I wasn’t really thinking boudoir or some shit\). Anyway, it’s hard to keep focused these days with my history. 

Oh so while I’m not doing any of that shit basically I got messaged by one of my ex dealers \(my main one\) and he’s blackmailing me because I owe him money.  This was on Sunday.  So that’s been extremely distressing for me, and while only a few hundred dollars, that's a few hundred extra I don’t have.  So I have to ask my parents \(who aren’t on the best terms with and who might not want to lend me any money regardless and who I don’t wanna know about it anyway\) or my girlfriend who did offer.  She tends to use these kind of situations as a power trip.  I’m able to pay her back but I would rather not ask her for the money if she’s going to just use it to beat me over the head.  I literally would risk having my legs broken by this dude.  I’ve triple locked my apartment so I reckon I’m fairly safe.

She actually got at me for not paying him in the first place like I was a terrible person for not being a man of my word.  I mean I was so psychotic at the time I ended up screaming for days thinking I was being burnt alive and my memory is a bit fucked. Me and GF basically on a break at the time incidentally, part of why I’d gone off on such a massive bender again really. 

Anyway so it’s just rather hurtful that after getting these threats from a dealer, being massively triggered to use, now I’ve got my girlfriend going and getting wasted and inviting some douchebag to her house.  

Thing is her emotional support has been so important in my recovery and it’s all a really scary place for me to be in and I feel rather alone with it all.  I’ve not handled my shit very well in the past \- last year she informed me she was 8 weeks pregnant and got an abortion without so much as telling me where and I ended up relapsing and shortly thereafter in a coma in hospital. 

I love her very much.  What do I do?  How do I set boundaries?  I’m really scared of losing her, I’m scared that I won’t be able to cope with or without her.  

Thing is when I told her about being blackmailed, the only thing I really needed was some emotional support and for her to say yeah that’s shit.  She couldn’t even do that and then went off about how he must know where I live cos I banged some girl on my apartment who knows him, something that makes her insane with jealously.  Even though we weren’t together at the time and I’ve never spoken to that person since.  While we were on a break she saw other people too so it strikes me as rather unjust.

Should I try to explain my side of the story?,"This happened about five years ago. It still causes me a lot of pain, and I can't imagine how my friend - let's call her Laura - feels. For her to think that one of her closest friends betrayed her trust and took advantage of her must be horrible. But, at this point, I don't know if explaining my side of the story would cause more help or harm. 

Laura and I were really good friends in grad school. We had dinner at each other's houses, threw parties together, went out to lunch every week, sat next to each other in numerous classes … I considered her to be one of my closest friends and expected that we would be lifelong friends. 

Often, after late nights of drinking and dancing with friends, I would walk Laura home to make sure she got back safely. Sometimes, if we were both single at the time, this would end with us kissing on her porch before saying goodnight. Once or twice, it progressed to her spending the night in my bed, but we never did anything beyond make out. 

Before we go on, you should know a bit about Laura's personality - she is a very matter of fact person who is quite guarded with her deepest emotions. Even after years of friendship, there were things I could tell she kept private. She had more male than female friends and was someone that guys would refer to as a ""cool girl"" - straightforward, down to earth, and level-headed. Very low maintenance, and no drama. After she and I started crossing the bounds of platonic friendship by making out on occasion, we explicitly discussed what was going on and both agreed that it was not romantic and that we would stop if either of us started dating someone. 

Now, on to the night in question. Laura was out at a bar with some of our mutual friends and I was at my apartment watching a movie. Laura called me on her way home; she was walking alone and it was around 1am so she wanted to be in touch with someone in case anything bad happened. We had a lighthearted conversation and she didn't seem to be slurring her words or any other noticeable sign of intoxication. All of a sudden, I hear her scream and then the line went dead. I immediately jump on my bicycle and rode over to her house, where I found her sitting on her front porch sobbing uncontrollably. She had been mugged and had lost her cellphone and purse. Her roommates weren't home, so she had no way of getting into her house. 

I stayed with her until she calmed down and then walked her back to my place. We spent at least two hours sitting on my bed cancelling her credit cards and calling her mom. During this time I asked her how intoxicated she was and she replied that she was ""not drunk at all"". Finally we crawled into bed around 4am. Almost immediately we found each other under the sheets and began to kiss, although this time it kept going and we ended up having sex. I will fully admit, in retrospect, that such an emotionally charged occasion was probably not the right time to sleep with someone for the first time, but by every indication, it was entirely consensual. 

The next morning, in classic Laura fashion, she turned to me and matter-of-factly stated, ""So, we had sex last night"". ""Yep"", I replied. ""Good talk,"" she said. And that was the last we ever spoke about it. I took her out for breakfast and we had friendly conversation - she seemed to have fully calmed down and was back to her normal self. About a week later, she began dating a guy at school; they became serious and Laura and I never had any intimate physical contact again.

The only person I told about what happened between Laura and me was a close mutual friend of ours, who we'll call James. About a year later, Laura and James were catching up over dinner. Somehow the topic of sexual partners came up, and Laura mentioned she had only been with five people. James casually mentioned that I was one of them, and Laura was stunned. She said she had no memory of sleeping with me. She called me later that evening in tears, asking if it was true. I of course said yes; I was too bewildered to say much besides that, as I couldn't comprehend how she wouldn't remember what happened. 

About a week later I got a call from Laura saying she had talked it over with her fiancé (the same guy who she had started dating right after our encounter). They had decided that she would completely end her friendship with me. They had also set ground rules for her behavior in the future, including that she would never get blackout drunk without him present. I was too stunned to say anything but that I understood and was sorry for the pain this had caused her. 

It wasn't until I reflected on the conversation afterward that it fully dawned on me what she must have concluded - that she had been blackout drunk that night and that I had taken advantage of her vulnerability to have sex with her. Because she was unable to give consent, legally this would mean that I raped her. 

I have no explanation for how she doesn't remember what happened. I am convinced that she was not blackout drunk - she didn't appear drunk at all, she very clearly told me she was not drunk before we went to bed, and she remembered (and brought up) the encounter the next morning. I don't know if the emotions of the night simply overshadowed the event, especially given how casual she was about it when we spoke the next morning. I don't know if it's possible for traumatic shock to cause short term memory loss like this. Whatever the explanation, she concluded that I raped her and ended our friendship over it. 

I was, and still am, heartbroken over this. I want to explain to her my side of the story. Putting myself in her shoes, I certainly don't expect it would be easy to hear the person you think raped you trying to tell you that you're wrong. But, at the same time, I can't imagine that it would be better for her to go through life thinking that someone she trusted completely had betrayed her like that. 

I don't know what to do. Should I try to write her a letter explaining what happened? Should I keep my distance and accept that the pain of reopening old wounds would be greater than the benefit of healing them? If it were you, would you want to know? 

tl;dr: I rescued my close friend after she was mugged and brought her back to my place, where we proceeded to have sex. Even though she wasn't drunk, she doesn't remember the encounter and concluded that I raped her. She ended our friendship and hasn't spoken to me in years. I don't know if I should try to explain my side of the story.

She’s sweet and caring and she makes me feel so absolutely happy. But there’s one thing that bothers me. 

I drink a good amount every so often with my friends and I don’t judge people who drink or do drugs or anything. But whenever my girlfriend drinks or jokes about getting drunk I get this nasty feeling in my stomach and chest. Its only happened a couple times since we’ve been dating and the one time we got drunk together she got pretty wasted and I was worried the whole time because she said she didn’t feel good and felt like she was gonna puke. Then, the other night she was going to have a couple drinks and I told her I didn’t think it was a good idea because she’s been dealing with a death in the family. I feel really weird about it thought because I feel like that wasn’t something I should have said. She got kind of upset with me about it but we moved on. 

Now tonight she’s drinking again and I got that feeling in my stomach again and so I left the conversation pretty quickly.

Basically I’ve had a pretty big crush on this girl since about September, but over the past 3 months or so we’ve become best friends and I’ve developed strong feelings for her. We hang out multiple times a week, work together, and talk all the time. I’m obviously very attracted to her and I’m assuming she’s at least a little bit attracted to me (she has drunkenly texted me some messages that could not be misconstrued), but I don’t think she reciprocates the same romantic feelings that I have. 

All of these would be things that I could man up about and could probably ask her out eventually, but at the last second she chose another school over the one I’m going to. Basically, she will live a few hours away for the next 4 years. 

Currently my 2 (incredibly shitty) plans are to get drunk as fuck at a party and confess, or just ignore the problem until next year and we (most likely) drift apart, but I admittedly have no idea what I’m doing.

My husband moved here from another country and I finally met his best friend [36/m] for the first time. They're both so alike, both physically (tall, lanky Europeans) and in behavior/sense of humor, but his best friend has that look that I have consistently gone for until my husband (square jaw, square hairline, dark hair, dark brows, dark, deep-set eyes). He grew up like I did, with conflicting national identity and speaking several languages during everyday life. They're both dominants in their relationships with the same preferences.

He has the energy I like, and the same impulsive, care-free attitude that I have--we're both polar opposites of my husband!! he's very responsible, calculated, stable--and I don't want him as he's definitely confirmed-bachelor-for-life type, but I can't figure out why I can't stop thinking about him. I'm so ashamed, I don't love my husband any less, but I can't stop thinking about his best friend. 

For now, I'm vowing to avoid being around him and using school/friends as my excuse to avoid him. Gratefully, he's back in his home country, and life has returned to normal. I'm still experiencing withdrawals. After only hanging out for a few hours for two days, I didn't know this is possible!

Yet (27m) my ex (25f) I cheated on, is the one trying to save me. What is happening?","I dated this girl for 2 years, we will call her Gina. I made emotionally abusive mistakes because I came to realize I have been hiding my true self for the past 18 years, and was afraid of someone seeing the monster I perceive myself as. I tried to push her away to save her the hurt. I didn't know how to let her in, because I've been closed off so long. My mom abandoned me; i grew suicidal, and manipulative. Broken home and all growing up. I can't even remember where the pain all started. I feel lost. Gina could always tell something was off, and tried to get me to open up. Maybe it's because she went yo college for psyc. I know I screwed up. It all came to a head as I cheated 2 days before our 2 year anniversary. I have a history of cheating, and lying that I fought for 2 years not to repeat. She tried leaving a few times during the relationship because she was tired of me not changing as promised, and couldn't handle the abuse (rightfully so). I couldn't get over the last time she tried to leave, and became unhappy for the month leading up to cheating.

Gina found out. I came clean about all the wrong I've done to her, and everyone before her because she got proof from my ex's that I was, in fact, a chronic cheater. She was mad I fealt I had to lie and that I hurt her so badly. But she accepted me, and forgave me, understanding the struggle. Understanding why I acted out in the relationship. She always took care of my every need, and did anything to see me smile. Loved me so fully.Yet, I broke her time and time again. I regret it, and refuse to be who I was.

I left her for Chelsea. Right from the beginning, I told her everything about my ugly past. I finally opened that door. She left me for another guy 3 weeks in. I feel like I connected with her more than anyone else. I miss her more, and want her more than Gina after 2 years. Chelsea left after I spent $800 on gifts for her and taking her on extravagant dates over those couple weeks. Which I doubt I ever spent that on Gina in 2 years, and feel sick for doing things for Chelsea that I should have done for Gina. I wanted to hurt myself, and Chelsea called Gina over to help her watch me. Chelsea then left soon after Gina arrived. Gina has been taking care of me for 4 days- staying over to cook, reassure me I'm the opposite of what my demons say, all while knowing entirely, I only want Chelsea's love. But she just wants me happy and safe, and will still do anything in her power to do so. I can talk to her about anything now unlike before, even about Chelsea. I still love Gina, but I don't understand how she doesn't hate me. Why she wants to help, or why she still cares. Why I'd even deserve her grace. I'm glad we have become closer through this than ever before in the relationship* I have made it clear that I'm not using Gina. She knows everything*

Chelsea keeps telling me to not move on yet, because she isn't sure about this dude. But she tells me to stop caring so much. Ignores me, and only texts me about when I want to sell her my motorcycle or if she can keep the gifts bought for her. Its sporadic, and feels like she does it to keep me strung along. 

Why is this hurting so much after only knowing eachother 3 weeks? Is it because I finally decided to give my all, and be honest too? Why is chelsea trying to keep me around when she has wanted this other dude so badly for years? How can Gina still be so good to me? Most importantly, HOW CAN I HEAL MYSELF AFTER LOSING MYSELF SO MANY YEARS AGO?

Tl;dr- cheated on girlfriend. Realized I treated her so badly because I was hiding my locked away demons. She forgave me, and is currently making sure I don't hurt myself after chelsea dumped me for another guy.

647,8jhhbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jhhbj/22f_ive_been_friended_on_social_media_by_certain/,[22/f] I've been friended on social media by certain members of my boyfriend's (22/m) family. I want to maintain boundaries but I also want to be kind and open. Any thoughts?,"The title basically explains it, but here are some more details: My [22/f] long term boyfriend of 2 years [22/m] and I have recently graduated college, and had a small celebration with our families afterwards. His father's girlfriend, who I've met once and his step-aunt were there as well as our immediate families. 

Since then, they have both sent me friend requests on social media. Normally, I'd be fine with this: the more the merrier, right? Except it's a little more complicated than that. I barely know his dad's girlfriend (she's the second one he's had, and I knew the first one a bit better,) and I'm not sure I want to friend her and then go to the trouble of blocking her from seeing my stuff. I don't post much, or anything vulgar, but I'm shy and I don't know her at all.

The step-aunt is a little more problematic to me. I'm Jewish (non-practicing, but whatever,) and last Christmas when we visited, I'm pretty sure she made a joke about ""the [slur that starts with a k and refers to Jewish people]s"". When it happened, I couldn't believe what I had heard and just laughed nervously. My boyfriend's mom was there and didn't say anything. I felt hurt, alone, and marginalized. I've even had trouble believing myself that it happened, but there aren't a whole lot of words that rhyme with that slur so... there it is.

Also: I don't even know if she knows that I'm Jewish, and I don't want to confront her about it. Needless to say, I don't feel very comfortable with her in person anymore (I'm as polite as humanly possible, but still hurt,) so I don't want to let her in more than I need to.

What should I do in person and online?

tl;dr: boyfriend's non-immediate family, including step-aunt that dropped an anti-semitic slur in my presence, want more contact with me than I am comfortable with, but I can't stall forever.

To start off we've always had a great relationship.. she is literally my best friend.. my person.. We broke up in December of 2015 \(2 months after moving to another city so I can go to school\) We still lived together after breaking up for about 2 months \(big mistake\) Because I thought, maybe if I stay I can try and win her back.. You may be wondering why we broke up in the first place.. Well we were arguing a lot over petty stuff and we were having financial issues.. We were just getting lost in everything going on and started drifting apart.. Any who we were just in a bad place now on to January 2016 \(the start of the worst year of my life\) We get into a huge I mean the biggest fight we've ever had.. she basically confirmed that we were nothing and her saying that just triggered a panic attack in me \(clearly I was attached to her at the time\) so then she calms me down and puts me to bed.. I wake up at 4am and she's not home clearly I start freaking out again and I decide to blow up her phone and they all get forwarded. This is when my psycho instincts come in and I somehow figure out the password to her FindMyPhone app. Basically, I find her with another girl \(a coworker\). A girl that I had a feeling there was something going on with. Moving on to February I was driving home from my hometown and I was still living with my ex at this time and she was having a party and had asked me to give her a couple of mins so she can clear the house before I get there.. Well this turned into an hour or so and yea I waited until it was okay to go to my own apartment yea I had no sense.. Any who I come home to my ex gf pissed drunk on the toilet almost passed out and loopy and I can tell something had happened.. So of course being me I went through her phone to find out that she had kissed the same little girl that she was with the other night. That's what truly propelled me to get my things and move out the week after. A month later I find out that she's dating this little girl. So I decided to block her and keep no contact. She ended up breaking up with the girl after 6 months and somehow we started ""dating"" again. But what was that for.. she wanted to keep this girl as her ""friend"" and I wasn't having it so I cut the cord again and she got back with her again. Fast forward to December 2016, I was going through a rough time and I decided to unblock her number one day.. and I'm at work and I had put my phone down and when I go back I have a miss call from my ex.. my heart and stomach DROPPED I hadn't seen or spoken to her in months and the day I decide to unblock her number is the day I get a missed call from her!? Like wtf!? Any who I texted her to see what the hell she wanted and her responds was I'm sorry I didn't think the call would go through.. \(She knew she was blocked\) She confessed that she's called me every day hoping I would answer so she can talk to me because she missed me \-.\- So of course I missed her too and we agree to meet up and have lunch and well one thing led to another and she ends up cheating on her then gf with me.. multiple times.. But finally they break up about 3 weeks later for other reasons.. This is when we tried to work things out again but her ex gf just kept creeping up and I had enough of it by April 2017 and by that point I was done started seeing someone new and one day I was on a date with this new person and my ex starts texting me wanting to meet up.. and just like that I drop the new person and got back together with my ex. And ever since then our relationship has improved 1000000&#37; she dropped her ex and everything the only thing that bothers me is that her ex still follows her on social media but not visa versa.. I hate that this girl gets to see everything my now fiancée is up to.. Fast forward to now it's been a year since we got back together officially.. she proposed to me and I said yes. I know I love her and I know want to be with her more than anything in this world no questions asked but I can't help sometimes but think about the past and how messed up she was to me and I get it.. we weren't together she technically didn't cheat on me but I just feel like I was emotionally cheated on because I wasn't the only one trying to save the relationship.. she was too! But I just can't help but think about those bad times that we had.. even though we had 3 amazing years I can't help but think about that one bad year.. I can't help but compare myself to that little girl.. I get it.. I have the ring.. I have my dream girl.. I am living my dream life! Now why can't I just forgive her and let go of the past!? I need help.. 

p.s. I have anxiety and I tend to overthink and second\-guess everything..

655,8jgt78,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jgt78/i_19m_recently_discovered_my_girlfriend_18f_has/,I [19/m] recently discovered my girlfriend [18/f] has been posting her nudes on her NSFW Tumblr.,"Just a little backstory. My girlfriend and I have been going out for 2.5 years. Things are great. We love each other very much and spend a good amount of time with each other, while giving one another space when needed. However, recently, my girlfriend and I have been arguing pretty frequently, usually over something little, which later stems into something big. When my girlfriend and I argue, it often takes days to come to a conclusion, as our usual means of conversation is through text, and we ignore each other a bit. We both agree that it is much healthier to resolve our issues in person as opposed to text, and that when we aren't arguing, our relationship is great.

On to my main point. I was on my girlfriend's PC fixing a small issue that she had when I noticed a bookmark folder with a strange title. I recognized the link as being a Tumblr user, and so I pulled it up on my laptop so as to not be suspicious. I scrolled through the blog and was astonished to see that she had been posting nearly nude pictures of her in her lingerie. Not the light-hearted type of pictures that girls will post on their Instagram for attention, but rather closer to the pictures that some girls on /r/GW will post as incentive for their fans to pay for. I also saw her answers to a bunch of her ""fans'"" questions that just generally made me uncomfortable. Such as if she spits or swallows, owns any sex toys, if she had a boyfriend, or the types of guys that she's into. For the most part, all of her answers sort of encouraged discussion with her fans. I was just extremely hurt and uncomfortable reading them, especially since many of the pictures that she posted had nearly a 1000 notes.

In the past, my girlfriend and I have had problems with her feeling unwanted. I will agree that when she sends me nude photos I don't egg her on as much as she used to, but this is an issue of my mental health and a separate conversation on its own. My girlfriend approached me months ago (which I now assume is around the time she made the Tumblr) about how I'd feel if she posted her nude photos online. I told her that I honestly would not be okay with knowing that creepy guys were beating their meat to her, and that her pictures would stay on the internet forever.

I know the password to her account since she uses the same password for everything, however, I am leaning against logging onto it, as I am not sure if I'm ready to see something I shouldn't. I almost don't even want to have a conversation with her, as she's had this blog for months. If I had never discovered it would she had even told me? I'm thinking of flat out breaking up with her, since we've had an argument in the past about her not liking me masturbating to porn, which she considers cheating, which I find now to be pretty ironic. How should I go about this situation? 

TL;DR: I found my girlfriend's Tumblr to which she posts her nude photos. We've previously talked about me not being comfortable with it.

**Edit 1**: My girlfriend and I recently joked about how much we disliked neckbeards, and that if I were a girl I would definitely sell my used panties/socks for money.

Before that, we were together only 6 months.

A bit of background: Since we started our distance, we’ve had trouble. We are in an open relationship. We both have dated and slept with other people since I moved away. I started seeing a new guy when I moved who I totally hit it off with, and it triggered a whole host of insecurity and jealousy in him that I wasn’t anticipating. After 3 months, I ended it with the new guy to maintain things with him. I haven’t been with anyone else since.

He has broken up with me three different times since then. Each time he has said his problem still stems from my feelings towards that other person. Each time he comes back and asks for me to get back together.

Things have been going well in recent months and we were making plans to close the distance with him moving here and us getting an apartment together. I was just about to lease an apartment for us when he blew up this week because I didn’t call him soon enough after a night out. I was initially defensive, but then I apologized and wanted to work through it. He started talking about how we weren’t right for each other, I don’t respect him, etc. I told him that if it was the end for him, I wouldn’t be coming back this time. He decided it was. Now, he’s begging for me back, saying this time it will work. I am not budging.

This all said, I have to say that when it’s good, it’s REALLY good. We have the same interests, we’re very affectionate, we care about each other, we have so much fun together. I really do love him. But I can never shake how unsettling some of his behavioral patterns are. It really feels as though when he’s upset he tries to manipulate me into feeling sorry for him. He gets so upset over little things I either do or don’t do - things that I don’t even think of as being potentially frustrating. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells constantly. It makes me feel like horseshit.

He also told me when we broke up this week that he has been lying to me all this time about having his college degree. He never finished. This is problematic for a lot of reasons. It directly inhibits the plans he had to get a new job here, it makes me worried about how driven he is (or isn’t, I guess), and it has absolutely demolished the trust I have for him.

I guess I just want to know that I’m doing the right thing. Every time he calls me and I have to tell him it’s not happening absolutely tears me apart. I’m also reeeeeal afraid of being alone. So. Lots of layers here.

Any advice?

660,8jggle,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jggle/i_started_feeling_insecure_about_my_relationship/,I started feeling insecure about my relationship when it wasn't there at the beginning.,"I (19/M) have been dating my current girlfriend (19/F) for five months now. The beginning of the relationship was going great,
but as time went on, I became increasingly insecure about the relationship. We met at the beginning of our freshman 
year in college and starting dating in December. We were exclusive for some time before that, starting at around
October. Obviosuly, we were in college, so we both have our sexual pasts, and this didn't bother me at first.
However, at this point in the relationship I have become very uncomfortable with this, in all likelihood a result
of insecurity. I've spent the past few days trying to determine the root of this insecurity, and why it would arise 
mid-relationship. Here's what I've come up with so far:

- She has had sex someone else on the first night of meeting them and has said she would not have done that
with me. 
- She said she got the ""butterflies"" with her ex-boyfriend but not with me, leading her to question 
whether or not she had feelings for me several times between October and December. 
- She complained about my height. 
- While we first hooking up, she asked me if she could still be with another guy. 
- After having declared being in a relationship together, she denied it being true to her roomamte. She obviously
never did this with her ex-boyfriend. 
- Also at the beginning of when we were started hooking up, she and her friend made a pro-con list comparing me
to another guy she was with at the time. It was after this that she asked if she would be with both of simultaneously.
(Not literally of course, separately if that wasn't clear)

Clearly, the bulk of these problems are a result of me feeling inadequate compared to the guys she has been with
in the past. However, I don't feel that way myself, I'm just worried that's what she thinks. 
I don't want to blame her for the way I am not but I can't think of any other reasons for these problems to arise
mid-relationship. Is it unfounded for me to feel insecure based on what's happened? We're really good together and would really like a way to make this work.

How should I go about doing this? (See info for characteristics of both of us)

Note: Scince my previous post my crush on girl 1 from that post has faded pretty much completely, and this post is about girl 2.
Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/83yeed/pursue_my_crush_or_go_for_someone_with_a/

So, there is this really cute girl in my class, who I've been talking to for the past couple of weeks, dropping hints here and there. I really like her, and I think she likes me back. Although she is very pretty, she actually isn't in a relationship as far as I know (next time it comes up in one of our conversations I will ask her), and neither is she the girl everyone wants (again, as far as I know). I really think I'm on to something here, and I don't want to mess this up. Signs she has shown include: staring at me during lessons and not looking away when I look back, asking me for help, even though she is sitting next to someone else who could help her, seeming interested in talking with me, and some more. The biggest hint I've given so far is flat-out stating that I'm single (in the proper context, and later my friend said it sounded very natural). This was very recently, so I haven't 'observed' her for very long scince to see if her behaviour has changed.
I am playing around with the idea of looking at her clothing habits for the next week or 2, then mentioning I like a particular piece of clothing, and seeing if she starts wearing it more often. If that is the case, I can be pretty much 100% sure she at least has interest in me. Should I do that or is it wasted energy? 

I think I should move on to bigger hints, similar to the stating I'm single, but I don't really know what would be appropriate, semi-natural hints I could drop into conversations.  

Info: She's very pretty, as mentioned before, but despite that, I might be the only one seriously trying to build a relationship with her. She also isn't really an attention grabber. She's quite a bit shorter then me, about 10-15cm, but that could also be because I am pretty tall. I'm not extremely social and dont want to approach her in groups (any tips about singling her out would be welcome as well). I am the same age as her, and we are in the same class, and will remain that way for at least the next 3 years, so time isn't too big of a concern, although summer holiday is comming up. She's very smart, and although I am considered the smart-guy in our class, she's a bit better at then me at pretty much every subject. I am definitely not as pretty as her, but I am not ugly either (I think). We are both not sporty at all, but we do both bike to school, which we live on litteral opposite sides of, quite far away from each other. 

To summarise: 
What are good, semi-natural hints I could drop? 
Should I do the clothing experiment? 
What are good ways to single her out in breaks, so I can talk to her more comfortably? 
(general relationship tips, smaller hints and hints she could drop are welcome too!)

I really hope this relationship works out, and that this post might help someone else as well.

I posted on a group chat a video after amd she viewed it, so she still has messenger. Just confused, not really buthurt about it. Why would she send that, then block me afterwards im assuming? Chances of her messaging me in future?","['confuse', 'af', 'be', '23', 'have', 'see', 'girl', 'like', 'week', 'talk', 'everyday', 'sex', 'couple', 'time', 'message', 'night', 'ask', 'weekend', 'reply', 'morning', 'say', 'get', 'arrest', 'go', 'reply', 'say', 'person', 'not', 'recieve', 'message', 'block', 'messenger', 'facebook', 'post', 'group', 'chat', 'video', 'amd', 'view', 'messenger', 'confused', 'buthurt', 'send', 'block', 'be', 'assume', 'chance', 'message', 'future']"

673,8jf481,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jf481/16m_my_girlfriend_17f_just_friendzoned_me_but/,(16/m) my girlfriend (17/f) just friendzoned me but told my friends I was stressing her out. I want to get her back. Advice?,"I met this girl a month and half ago. She's one grade above me and sits behind in my politics class. My friends are friends with her and eventually we spoke and hit it off immediately (she wanted me to go to a school dance/dinner). I wasn't immediately interested but joked about going if she paid for half of the ticket. A week or so later I found out she had a boyfriend. Fast-forward two weeks of us flirting, she breaks up with her boyfriend and we get a bit more intimate. We finally get real about going to the dance together and she ends up paying half. I end up going home with her before the dance and we just cuddle and flirt. Blah blah we kiss several times and dance all night. Over the next few weeks everythings seems pretty stable with a bit of escalation. We would cuddle and be really touchy at school. Evertime we were together she would playfully grab my crotch EXTREMELY flirtatiously.

I've only been with one other girl but that was when I was 13 and I was an absolute loser back then. I barely managed to kiss her twice and we were always off and on. I would usually get really insecure and be a total cuck after I got in the relationship.

This time tho i thought i was doing pretty good. We had a couple rough patches on my part like me laughing off my friend hitting her arm repeatedly and i admit i totally cracked and went full beta when this happened, adamantly apologizing.

I was a virgin (I did get a shitty blowjob on halloween though last year) and she had slept with a few guys and did it often when with them.

The night before the breakup I went out with my boys who were also in our politics class. We ended up spam calling her while she was at the movies (of which she didn't tell me she was at) and asking her if she wanted to go for a ride. She ended up getting kind of mad but it didn't seem like too much. That night at 1am she facetimed me and she was somewhat flirtatious and giggling about me making her mad. The next day i didn't receive any texts. I asked her casually what she was doing for mother's day and she responded a couple hours later with ""eating ass"". I jokingly said ""great now I know what to do in 5 years"". She shut the joke down another couple hours later with ""we gots to slow down"". I expressly stated it was a joke and continued to say ""we have to slow down"". This coming from the girl that full on grabbed my dick in a busy Subway (the restaurant) and said she hoped she didn't get any of her 'wetness' in my friends car when we went. I said we can slow down and she just continued. I eventually started asking her why and she just said she wanted to be friends. She saw me as a friend and nothing more. Also that previous day she showed her new bathing suit and expressly showed her ass to me. The conversation fizzled out into her saying she wanted to stay friends and asked if I was angry. I said I was angry but I was going to bed. She finished with saying she was sorry and that it was up to me to stay friends.

At first I was upset, but after a few minutes I got incredibly pumped. I worked out for the first time in forever (im a tall skinny guy but toned (6-pack without exercise) and cleaned my room and just did some general good stuff for me.

Today (aka the next day) I didn't hangout out with her in the morning and just stood tall and smiled everywhere I went. I read about ignoring her and giving her space but she ended up asking me something in class and I responded too kindly I think. My friends joked around with them as usual. Later my friends and me were joking about kissing eachother and my ex's friend passive-aggressively joked about me wanting to kiss my ex. I kinda just laughed and mumbled off saying yeah whatever.

I always made dirty jokes and her more so, boasting about her blowjob skills and straight up grabbing my dick almost everytime we hung out. My guy friends would always say ""can you guys just fuck already"". About a week ago I started opening up about the idea of sex (a running thing with me was that i wasn't into it, until I met her of course).

We had a fight a week ago to where she joked about sucking another guys dick and her friend and even my other friend all continued to say yes and go along with it. I brushed it off and just smiled saying yeah ok. They continued with it until our class together when I got extremely angry and almost flat out said if you did then we're over. Thats when she said it was just a joke and I immediately perked up and was back to my old self. I did make a few remarks to not saying or doing that but nothing serious. Later that night she started the joke again until I told her it wasn't funny and somewhat hesitantly said to drop it and never joke about it. She said alright. She continued to mention it for the next few days though.

Her previous couple of boyfriends were definitely more built than me but i was sure I had them more than beat with charm afterall she broke up with a man to be with me after a week. Her grandmother has cancer and she fights with her family a lot, crying at least twice a week. She often struggles with anxiety and stress and cannot bare the thought of the future.

At this point getting her back isn't my priority but more why she ended and said what she said.

Did I just come off as to immature and aloof? Or did I seem too needy and naive?

I thought I escalated it enough but I did act as her emotional tampon often which might have contributed to the friendzone.

I don't have a job, don't partake in hobbies or go out much. Did  I just lack ambition and seem immature?

I read a lot about getting her back and most said just give her space and improve yourself. But part of that improvement was going out with other girls and showing I wasn't a loser and make her jealous.

But I mean what if she felt I was too much, that I came off to strong and she felt not worthy?

I'm a mess right now tho I'm good at not showing it. I'm also sorry for making that really long but I just need someones insight.

Should I just disregard her and make her jealous with other girls (already found one im interested in and she seems interested in me) or improve myself and give her space?

Did I come on to strong and scare her off, too immature and not serious, or am I just not good enough? Is it moreso my fault or her just dealing with a lot and me not being the guy that she needs?

This has gotten too long so I’ll just add a note that she is not a hoe and is definitely open to relationships.

Thanks to everyone that got this far.

674,8jf2eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jf2eb/i_42f_need_to_know_my_husbands_37m_actions/,I [42F] need to know my husband's [37M] actions warrant my leaving.,"My husband and I have been together 8 years, married 7. Things were wonderful in the beginning. I thought I had found the love of my life. After we had our first child, we decided that I would stay home with him and quit my job. My husband makes six figures, so I didn't need to work. We did that with the understanding that I would return to work once the youngest of our children went into kindergarten. Things went drastically downhill after the birth of our second son, almost 3. My husband started saying awful things to me, would scoff at anyone who said I had a difficult job, and basically offered me zero emotional support. It's been like that for almost three years. 

Some examples of what he has said and done:

Said I was bad mother because I can't keep the house clean. Our house is huge. And, yes, it is a mess. I have two toddlers. I clean up and it's messy 10 minutes later. He doesn't understand this at all. At one time I had a friend of mine helping me clean because she needed extra money, but he shut that down and said we couldn't afford it. \(Again, six figures\). I do everything for my kids. Take them to preschool, all appointments, buy their clothes and their food, basically spend time with them. He sits on the couch with his phone for the time he is at home and sits the kids in front of the tv, or he'll just yell at my oldest to clean up things. He thinks he's a better parent than me.

Speaking of money, he constantly accuses me of spending too much. He says he has to work long hours to keep up with my spending. He said he hadn't been able to put any money in savings for months. I don't normally check the savings account, but I found the login and saw that our savings had increased about $12k in the time he said there was no money going in. I also looked at our checking account. Every month our spending is lower than what we put in by at least $2k, sometimes $1k if it's around the holidays. Even with the numbers in front of his face, he says he's right. At one point he drafted a budget and anything having to do with me \(personal grooming, clothing, pet care\) wasn't included because we ""couldn't afford it""\- I shop at budget stores, I have zero designer anything. He said I had $75 a month to spend on that stuff. That was impossible, I told him, he went tone deaf, so I've ignored that. 

There have been instances of verbal abuse, in public and private. He will call me a bitch, an idiot, and other such names.  He once yelled at me and called me ""a fucking idiot"" in a parking lot with people around because I wasn't lifting the stroller like he wanted. Another time when we were on vacation, he called me ""a fucking lazy bitch,"" again, in front of people\-including our children, because I wanted to walk about 20 steps to look at the ocean before we unloaded the car.  I'm a moron because I'm a different political affiliation. 

While I was still breastfeeding our youngest, he insisted I go back to school so I ""could get off my ass and get a job."" I started school that fall, and I'm about to finish after the fall and have maintained a 4.0 GPA with two toddlers.  He treats me like I am nothing but a parasite. I don't have a ""real job,"" therefore I am lazy.  

He has told me he is incapable of empathy. He won't even attempt to look at things from my perspective. He has a very authoritarian personality. Someone is always better than someone else and he is better than me. If we have any disagreement he will always say he is right because he uses logic and I just use emotion. Have I mentioned my degree field is IT? He believes emotions are flaws, except for anger apparently.

 He thinks he can be critical of me, and never say a kind word about me, but if he says, ""I love you"" or hugs me or something I should automatically be ready for sex. I don't enjoy sex with him.

 We went to marital counseling. We had a couple of couple's sessions and then I had a one\-on\-one. In the one\-on\-one session, the therapist said if my husband can't understand my basic needs, then I should leave. We talked about approaching him with this in our next session. When our next session came, my therapist said nothing about what we talked about. He wanted to talk about our finances. I felt so betrayed that I haven't sought out counseling from anyone else. I am depressed to the point of barely hanging on \(I am on medication\).  I feel more alone than I ever have. But I also have the kids, and no job right now. My parents love my husband because he's on their side politically. They would give me hell if I left, and they are the ones that watch my kids when I go to school or have appointments. 

What should I do? I don't really have any close friends that can help me because I have social anxiety and have a hard time making friends.  I have no personal savings anymore. Our home was going to be passed down to our kids. My kids are happy here. Does the way my husband treats me warrant leaving? I've dealt with it for so long, all these things end up seeming like not a big deal.  I don't know what to do.

tldr: husband seems abusive, but I've dealt with it for so long, it's just normal to me. We have toddlers and I don't know what to do\-stay or go. I am a stay\-at\-home mom and student, no job.","['42_f', 'need', 'know', 'husband', '37_m', 'action', 'warrant', 'leaving', 'husband', '8', 'year', 'married', '7', 'thing', 'wonderful', 'beginning', 'think', 'find', 'love', 'life', 'child', 'decide', 'stay', 'home', 'quit', 'job', 'husband', 'make', 'figure', 'need', 'work', 'understanding', 'return', 'work', 'young', 'child', 'go', 'kindergarten', 'thing', 'go', 'drastically', 'downhill', 'birth', 'second', 'son', '3', 'husband', 'start', 'say', 'awful', 'thing', 'scoff', 'say', 'difficult', 'job', 'basically', 'offer', 'zero', 'emotional', 'support', 'like', 'year', 'example', 'say', 'say', 'bad', 'mother', 'house', 'clean', 'house', 'huge', 'yes', 'mess', 'toddler', 'clean', 'messy', '10', 'minute', 'later', 'understand', 'time', 'friend', 'help', 'clean', 'need', 'extra', 'money', 'shut', 'say', 'afford', 'figure', 'kid', 'preschool', 'appointment', 'buy', 'clothe', 'food', 'basically', 'spend', 'time', 'sit', 'couch', 'phone', 'time', 'home', 'sit', 'kid', 'tv', 'yell', 'old', 'clean', 'thing', 'think', 'well', 'parent', 'speaking', 'money', 'constantly', 'accuse', 'spend', 'say', 'work', 'long', 'hour', 'spending', 'say', 'able', 'money', 'saving', 'month', 'normally', 'check', 'saving', 'account', 'find', 'login', 'see', 'saving', 'increase', '$', '12_k', 'time', 'say', 'money', 'go', 'look', 'checking', 'account', 'month', 'spending', 'low', '$', '2k', '$', '1k', 'holiday', 'number', 'face', 'say', 'right', 'point', 'draft', 'budget', 'have', 'personal', 'grooming', 'clothing', 'pet', 'care', 'include', 'afford', 'shop', 'budget', 'store', 'zero', 'designer', 'say', '$', '75', 'month', 'spend', 'stuff', 'impossible', 'tell', 'go', 'tone', 'deaf', 'ignore', 'instance', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'public', 'private', 'bitch', 'idiot', 'name', 'yell', 'call', 'fucking', 'idiot', 'parking', 'lot', 'people', 'lift', 'stroller', 'like', 'want', 'time', 'vacation', 'call', 'fucking', 'lazy', 'bitch', 'people', '-include', 'child', 'want', 'walk', '20', 'step', 'look', 'ocean', 'unload', 'car', 'moron', 'different', 'political', 'affiliation', 'breastfeed', 'young', 'insist', 'school', 'ass', 'job', 'start', 'school', 'fall', 'finish', 'fall', 'maintain', '4.0', 'gpa', 'toddler', 'treat', 'like', 'parasite', 'real', 'job', 'lazy', 'tell', 'incapable', 'empathy', 'attempt', 'look', 'thing', 'perspective', 'authoritarian', 'personality', 'well', 'well', 'disagreement', 'right', 'use', 'logic', 'use', 'emotion', 'mention', 'degree', 'field', 'believe', 'emotion', 'flaw', 'anger', 'apparently', 'think', 'critical', 'kind', 'word', 'say', 'love', 'hug', 'automatically', 'ready', 'sex', 'enjoy', 'sex', 'go', 'marital', 'counseling', 'couple', 'couple', 'session', '-on', '-one', '-on', '-one', 'session', 'therapist', 'say', 'husband', 'understand', 'basic', 'need', 'leave', 'talk', 'approach', 'session', 'session', 'come', 'therapist', 'say', 'talk', 'want', 'talk', 'finance', 'feel', 'betrayed', 'seek', 'counseling', 'depressed', 'point', 'barely', 'hang', 'medication', 'feel', 'kid', 'job', 'right', 'parent', 'love', 'husband', 'politically', 'hell', 'leave', 'one', 'watch', 'kid', 'school', 'appointment', 'close', 'friend', 'help', 'social', 'anxiety', 'hard', 'time', 'make', 'friend', 'personal', 'saving', 'anymore', 'home', 'go', 'pass', 'kid', 'kid', 'happy', 'way', 'husband', 'treat', 'warrant', 'leave', 'deal', 'long', 'thing', 'end', 'like', 'big', 'deal', 'know', 'tldr', 'husband', 'abusive', 'deal', 'long', 'normal', 'toddler', 'know', '-stay', 'stay', '-at', '-home', 'mom', 'student', 'job']"

My husband was diagnosed with congestive heart failure a few months ago. Before that, he had a terrible infection that took months for him to recover from. Thus, our family has been dealing with the situation for a few years now. 

I'm the main supporter and breadwinner for the family and it's been very tough on me. Most days, I will break down crying over my husband's condition and all of my responsibilities. I do my best to care for my husband and provide him with the support he needs. 

My daughter, on the other hand, does nothing to care for my husband. She does other household chores around the house and has a job, but refuses to do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to her father. She never cries, never says she feels bad for my husband, never talks to him about his condition.

She once admitted to me that she wishes he would just ""die already"" and that she would only feel relief when he died. One time, she did something on accident that could have seriously compromised her father's health and when I told her not to do it again, she promised me she wouldn't, but also told me that she only felt bad about what happened because she's not the type of person to hurt people, not because she specifically hurt her father.

Every time she sees me crying or having a small breakdown, she tells me to stop and says that it's not worth it. She says I overreact and am dramatic about everything and that my ""constant"" breakdowns cause her a lot of stress. 

I really just need help understanding if this is normal behavior or not? Are my breakdowns really causing that much stress on my family or is my daughter being self-centered? I genuinely can't tell anymore and I need help with knowing what to do about this.

tl;dr: Husband has a chronic condition that requires a lot of support. Daughter is emotionless about it and does nothing to help me with the situation. She gets upset whenever I have breakdowns and says it adds to her ""stress"".","['54_f', 'daughter', '19_f', 'totally', 'emotionless', 'uncare', 'father', '52_m', 'health', 'tell', 'overreact', 'underreacte', 'lot', 'situation', 'try', 'good', 'condense', 'possible', 'husband', 'diagnose', 'congestive', 'heart', 'failure', 'month', 'ago', 'terrible', 'infection', 'take', 'month', 'recover', 'family', 'deal', 'situation', 'year', 'main', 'supporter', 'breadwinner', 'family', 'tough', 'day', 'break', 'cry', 'husband', 'condition', 'responsibility', 'good', 'care', 'husband', 'provide', 'support', 'need', 'daughter', 'hand', 'care', 'husband', 'household', 'chore', 'house', 'job', 'refuse', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'come', 'father', 'cry', 'say', 'feel', 'bad', 'husband', 'talk', 'condition', 'admit', 'wish', 'die', 'feel', 'relief', 'die', 'time', 'accident', 'seriously', 'compromise', 'father', 'health', 'tell', 'promise', 'tell', 'feel', 'bad', 'happen', 'type', 'person', 'hurt', 'people', 'specifically', 'hurt', 'father', 'time', 'see', 'cry', 'have', 'small', 'breakdown', 'tell', 'stop', 'say', 'worth', 'say', 'overreact', 'dramatic', 'constant', 'breakdown', 'cause', 'lot', 'stress', 'need', 'help', 'understand', 'normal', 'behavior', 'breakdown', 'cause', 'stress', 'family', 'daughter', 'self', 'center', 'genuinely', 'tell', 'anymore', 'need', 'help', 'know', 'tl;dr', 'husband', 'chronic', 'condition', 'require', 'lot', 'support', 'daughter', 'emotionless', 'help', 'situation', 'get', 'upset', 'breakdown', 'say', 'add', 'stress']"

I [16/M] have been seeing this girl [15/F] for about 2 weeks now. I mean we have been with eachother but we have split up a couple of times because of personal problems but we are finally starting over.

I am a shy guy and I have been shy for all my life. Shyness is something my mom gave to me and I hate it. My problem is that I don't really come up with stuff to talk about and it can get very awkward sometimes. This makes me feel boring and not interesting at all. I do normal stuff everyday that everybody does but it feels like I am the only one that can't come up with things to talk about.

I really like this girl and I don't want it to end (not sure if that is even going to happen) because of my shyness. Next time I will try to put my arms around her or maybe hold hands but the main problem is that I don't really have much to say.

Do you have any tips or some good conversation starters that usually goes well? I do know that this will take practice but I have to start somewhere right?

Thanks :)","['pretty', 'shy', 'guy', 'hi', '16', 'm', 'see', 'girl', '15', 'f', '2', 'week', 'mean', 'eachother', 'split', 'couple', 'time', 'personal', 'problem', 'finally', 'start', 'shy', 'guy', 'shy', 'life', 'shyness', 'mom', 'give', 'hate', 'problem', 'come', 'stuff', 'talk', 'awkward', 'make', 'feel', 'boring', 'interesting', 'normal', 'stuff', 'everyday', 'everybody', 'feel', 'like', 'come', 'thing', 'talk', 'like', 'girl', 'want', 'end', 'sure', 'go', 'happen', 'shyness', 'time', 'try', 'arm', 'maybe', 'hold', 'hand', 'main', 'problem', 'tip', 'good', 'conversation', 'starter', 'usually', 'go', 'know', 'practice', 'start', 'right', 'thank']"

[NonRomantic]","TL;DR My (23F) former best friend (23F) of ten years exited  my life  over a year ago after a huge fight, and recently contacted me and we started hanging out again. However she’s still acting immature and unreliable, and I can’t decide if I should give her another chance. 

Let’s call her ‘Micah’

Fall of 2016 I ended a shitty and abusive 4.5 year relationship, and lss my ex talked to Micah and told her I cheated on him (which I did not) and a bunch of other lies. She believed him and proceeded to fight with me via text (I had just moved to college out of reasonable driving distance). After a few fights and her not listening to me, we ended out ten year friendship. I cut all ties, removed her from social media, deleted her number, the works. Except tumblr, where I forgot she follows me. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I made a post about removing toxic people from my life, and she texted me asking if the post was about her. We talked and she apologized for how our friendship ended and I agreed to give this another chance because I do still care about her. We got coffee on a Sunday and made plans for the following Friday. 

That whole week I didn’t hear anything from her, so come Friday I text her and ask if our plans are still on. She says she forgot and we make plans for coffee and shopping the next morning. She follows through on that, then we make plans for a double date that night. I text to confirm the double date in the afternoon and ask for her new address, and she never responds. That’s two consecutive nights of her flaking. 

We also made plans for coffee tonight, Monday. I wake up to a text asking to reschedule. 

In four days she has bailed on me three times. This was one of our fighting points when we stopped being friends, she is not reliable and will ditch me (or anyone, honestly) if something better comes up. I feel like I should give her a chance but I’m so tired of getting ditched and her bailing. 

Should I give her another chance? Either way I don’t even know what to say to her. Thanks in advance!

I'm currently with a long term partner of 7 years and 3 children. We've currently been going through a bit of a rocky patch but things are okay, and things seem to be back to normal.

However, a spanner has been thrown in the works for me. An old friend that I used to hang out with and we had a sexual relationship for 4 months whilst we lived abroad recently got in contact with me and wanted to meet up. Shes from the US and Im from the UK. I spoke with my partner about her visiting and she was fine with it, I was so relieved because I actually class her as a close friend. We was so close when we lived abroad, and things were aplified because of that. We shared a lot of deep and meaningful conversations. she paid a lot of money to do a de-tour to visit.

Anyway, she came to visit and met my kids, my partner and some family and friends. It was like we had never been apart and it was like seeing an old friend. It was 8 years ago we last seen each other.

However, initally I was just so excited to see this friend. In fact I have quite a lot of female friends, and thats all they are is friends. I thought this would be the same. But she's now traveled on to her new destination for 1 week, before she comes back... and I felt my stomach turn, a saddening feeling that she was not around. I'm not sure if I am getting feelings for her again or it's just I feel sad about not having much contact with her for some years.

There is a few things playing on my mind. When we lived abroad, I had recently came out of a relationship and I wasnt ready for another serious relationship. Not to mention I was from the UK and she was from the US. I told her I wanted to cool things off and we both agreed. But, all it would take was a text and we both would meet up. It was so hard for both of us. I decided to leave the country we was living in, and quite spontaneously within a week I was gone. I didnt give much of an explanation other than I wanted to go back home to explore a new chapter in my life. I felt so bad, but I was scared (of what I don't know). I felt I couldnt speak to her about why I was leaving, because Im happy to express my feelings quite openly with people, but I feel she is a bit more reserved (I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing). We exchanged a few messages over the years, the annual happy birthday and miss you messages, she initally wanted to skype me but I made excuses. I felt bad about how I delt with things, and I regularly thought about how I could of done things differently.

Anyhow, when driving her back to the airport I really wanted to explain to her, more of laying something to rest and moving on with our friendship but I couldnt build up the courage. I was scared of how she would react: Either make a move on me, or play it off and just say something short like don't worry. She did ask me why I left, and I told her the same answer as I did all the years ago, that I had to start a new chapter. It's really bothering me and I want to tell her, but I dont know how. I did text her to express my apprciation of her taking the time and money to come and see me.

I'm also scared that I have deeper feelings than friendship for her. I've never cheated on my partner and I never would. However I don't know how to respond to these feelings...

I also don't know my friends motives. I spoke briefly and vaguely to another friend, whom also happenes to be a female and said that she found it strange that she cut her vacation short, and spent quite a lot of money to come and see me.

Most of all I want this friend in my life, I just don't know the best way to go about it?

When she brought up concerns that I wasn’t all that invested, I ended it. We’re approaching 30, she’s in the market for something long term, and I’m more just dating in the moment, moving in together and marriage are a way off for me. 

However, we still had a lot of fun together and connected pretty well. We met each other’s families and went on a few weekend trips together. She was really into me, and I was into her - just probably not quite as much. I really care about her and don’t want her out of my life completely. 

Did I end things too early? Should I have given it more time? She’s devastated by it and I feel awful. It’s my first relationship so I’m worried I gave up a good thing.

There's this girl I've known my entire life(14 years YES I know I am a bit too young for this whole dating thing). When we were kids we often played together because our parents have been friends since college but after a few years they didn't come that often anymore. She started school a year before me so that means she is the same age as me but a grade higher. Then one time when she finally did come over once again three years ago I noticed how truly beautiful she was. Five months ago we went skiing together and we talked a little bit about school and such. We got along really well but then the day ended and I felt really sad and empty because I knew that I wouldn't be able to talk to her for a long time again.

So the thing is I told a friend about her and he promised me not to tell anyone. You can imagine what happened in the next few days. Also he was teasing her all the time so I built up the courage to go and talk to her about this and if I should help her with that. Then my 'friend' came around, heard that I was talking about him, jumped into the conversation and my crush told me that that was weird and left. I don't know how he did it but afterwards he became friends with her and started talking frequently. Now I think that she knows everything.

I'd love to spend time with her again, it doesn't even have to be in a boyfriend girlfriend kinda way (that would be a bit of a problem anyways because in our age these so called 'relationships' don't last that long and if our families get invited to each others homes it'd get very awkward). It's just fun talking to her. I get this warm feeling all over my body and just smile although I never smile. 

So, the thing is, I have no idea what to do. I just can't get her out of my head. I also don't want to fuck this whole thing up so we will never talk again. Recently I added her on Snapchat and she added me back too, I guess that's a good thing. But I already sent her two snaps and she didn't answer to either of them. Please just help me in this situation!

She was telling me how she doesnt like holidays like these because she feels alone and sad, I didn't really know what to say to her because I couldn't relate. I was being kind've quiet and she got mad because I wasn't really communicating, all I really said was I'm here for her, but she doesn't feel like she can talk to me about her issues. Sometimes when she shares her issues it brings me a little down because it hurts me when shes hurting or sometimes I don't know what to say. She doesn't feel like she can confide in me and I can make her better which sucks because I just want to make her feel better when she's down because she's always amazing and supportive for me. I just suck at communication and need help improving. Any advice?

I love him with everything I am, and so does he me. He honestly is the best guy I've ever met, and I wouldn't swap him out for anything... however, like all things too good to be true, there's a catch. We're in a long distance relationship. Of course, I try to see him as often as possible, but in\-between meets, our relationship is mostly through a screen. So when something goes wrong, it can be difficult to fix the problem, like whats happening right now. So, yesterday I went to a haunted house with my younger siblings just as a bonding kind of thing, and one part of the exhibit featured a scary\-clown room, filled with, as you can imagine, painted clown faces and statues covered in blood and smiling those sadistic smiles. While my siblings screamed and ran away, I thought the clowns were pretty funny, so I went to snapchat and filmed them. Now, let me mention that my boyfriend has an extreme phobia, of which I was aware, of clowns. And i took a video of these ones I was seeing, and sent them to various friends of mine, and my boyfriend. Later when I checked my phone, I saw his reply. And he was pissed. At first only pissed, because what I sent made it seem as if I was making fun of him and this great fear he has. Then he was disappointed, and now its the next day, and he hasn't spoken to me since blowing up yesterday. How do I fix this?

Looking for some guidance, I'm an only child, and I don't really know who I can talk to.

My girlfriend and I had/have been dating for 3.5 years. We both met in university, we are each other's first serious relationship. We've had our ups and downs, but we've mainly been rock solid. We both workout together, we both train in MMA together. But we have had our communication issues. I was quite introverted before meeting her so when we get into an argument, I have tended to be quiet and not address the problem; she's been one to bottle up her emotions until they finally snap.

Our relationship had some crappy days this last month. I could tell she wasn't as happy as normal but then she would have days where she was. We had planned a trip in Vancouver, during the trip, same thing. She had moments where she was happy, and moments she wasn't. We're both going through some struggles. She's starting her Master's program this fall, we had planned on moving in together. But that would also mean I would likely have to quit my current job, which pay's well and is quite stable. I have my fears and uncertainties, but for her I definitely would have.

As you all read this to yourselves, you guys are probably thinking I'm quite stupid, there's probably several red flags that we're probably better off, but I honestly don't think that.

The day after we came back from our vacation, we decided to have a talk. This was probably the most dialogue we'd had in the last month. She said she felt like she was obliged to spend time with me, which I never understood, I've always tried to give her the space she needs, but maybe I'm doing something wrong. 

Looking back over these past few days, I can acknowledge that I've been absent in making proactive steps to plan what would be our next steps together. A part of it is fear, but I've realized the thought of losing her is way scarier than the fear of what the future could hold.

Unfortunately/Fortunately, last night I watched the movie ""Happy Anniversary"" on Netflix, and I saw a lot of resemblance of my relationship in that movie. But as corny as that is, I found some hope that we could work past this. My parents have an arranged marriage and they are quite happy. Our relationship has never had any abuse, we just have shitty communication problems and we end up waiting too long, and then its boils into a much bigger issue.


I regret deeply that I let my relationship with her get to such a drastic point for me to realize what I had. I indeed want a future with her; it's quite hard for me to accept her decision.

I'm meeting her tonight to have a talk after our practice (that's another thing that sucks, I'll definitely be seeing her frequently as we train together). I'm just hoping it isn't all too late for me to fight for this relationship. I want her to be happy, and looking back at all the letters she's wrote me, she was happy. After 3.5 years the spark kind of faded, we both acknowledged its hard to have that spark with us living separately currently, but we were definitely looking forward to what the future had. 

Have I let this get out of hand? What can I do to ignite that spark again? 

Thanks for any thoughts, or advice that can be recommended. I know I threw a lot into this with no real structure. I've been keeping my thoughts to myself and my head feels like its imploding.","['24_m', '23_f', 'date', '3.5', 'year', 'break', 'day', 'come', 'vacation', 'hi', 'look', 'guidance', 'child', 'know', 'talk', 'girlfriend', 'date', '3.5', 'year', 'meet', 'university', 'relationship', 'up', 'down', 'mainly', 'rock', 'solid', 'workout', 'train', 'mma', 'communication', 'issue', 'introvert', 'meet', 'argument', 'tend', 'quiet', 'address', 'problem', 'bottle', 'emotion', 'finally', 'snap', 'relationship', 'crappy', 'day', 'month', 'tell', 'happy', 'normal', 'day', 'plan', 'trip', 'vancouver', 'trip', 'thing', 'moment', 'happy', 'moment', 'go', 'struggle', 'start', 'master', 'program', 'fall', 'plan', 'move', 'mean', 'likely', 'quit', 'current', 'job', 'pay', 'stable', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'definitely', 'read', 'guy', 'probably', 'think', 'stupid', 'probably', 'red', 'flag', 'probably', 'well', 'honestly', 'think', 'day', 'come', 'vacation', 'decide', 'talk', 'probably', 'dialogue', 'month', 'say', 'feel', 'like', 'oblige', 'spend', 'time', 'understand', 'try', 'space', 'need', 'maybe', 'wrong', 'look', 'past', 'day', 'acknowledge', 'absent', 'make', 'proactive', 'step', 'plan', 'step', 'fear', 'realize', 'thought', 'lose', 'way', 'scary', 'fear', 'future', 'hold', 'unfortunately', 'fortunately', 'night', 'watch', 'movie', 'happy', 'anniversary', 'netflix', 'see', 'lot', 'resemblance', 'relationship', 'movie', 'corny', 'find', 'hope', 'work', 'past', 'parent', 'arrange', 'marriage', 'happy', 'relationship', 'abuse', 'shitty', 'communication', 'problem', 'end', 'wait', 'long', 'boil', 'big', 'issue', 'regret', 'deeply', 'let', 'relationship', 'drastic', 'point', 'realize', 'want', 'future', 'hard', 'accept', 'decision', 'meet', 'tonight', 'talk', 'practice', 'thing', 'suck', 'definitely', 'see', 'frequently', 'train', 'hope', 'late', 'fight', 'relationship', 'want', 'happy', 'look', 'letter', 'write', 'happy', '3.5', 'year', 'spark', 'kind', 'faded', 'acknowledge', 'hard', 'spark', 'live', 'separately', 'currently', 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'let', 'hand', 'ignite', 'spark', 'thank', 'thought', 'advice', 'recommend', 'know', 'throw', 'lot', 'real', 'structure', 'keep', 'thought', 'head', 'feel', 'like', 'imploding']"

Anyway here is the story: I have been dating this girl \(call her A\) for 5 months. During the first 2 months it was all smooth. The last 3 months were still fantastic between us, HOWEVER, a grandparent of hers had become very ill and A needed to spend more time with the individual. This left less time for dates and seeing her, but the relationship was still solid. We made each other laugh, talked a bit about our personal lives, etc. However, as time passed, her grandparent's illness got worse and by the end of last month, the individual passed away. When it happened, I tried to comfort her at first. Messaged her once or twice everyday for 3 days asking if everything is ok and if she needs to talk to me about anything. She would be very cold and just say ""I'll be fine"" or sometimes not reply at all. That's fine, I thought, so I just gave her space for 4 days or so. After 5 days I message her and she is still barely replying to my messages; usually 3\-5 hours late. I completely understand the situation, however, when she did reply, I would reply back within a 5 minute time frame, and she would go silent again for 3\-5 hours. Eventually when I asked her to reply to me on time because I was concerned about her, she snapped at me saying that I do not understand her situation. I told her I did, since one of my grandparent's passed away recently, and followed up by saying that ""I just want to make sure you're ok. A then mentioned that I ""left her alone for 4 days"" and I followed up with ""please understand that from my perspective that you barely replied to my messages for 3 days and were unwilling to engage in conversation, and you never made it clear to me whether or not you needed space. So I left you alone for half a week"". I also said  ""Please just take 5\-10 minutes out of your day to talk to me and let me know that you're OK?."". She was silent for 20 or so minutes and then just follows up with ""we need a break!"" and then later that day she says we should end it.

Now I don't know where I went wrong. In the 5 months we dated I never yelled or argued with her. I was always kind and cared about her. Yet she abruptly ends it; Just out of thin air. I feel destroyed \(I still have feelings for her\) and puzzled. I was hoping you guys could help clarify what happened and why it did happen the way it did? On a side note, this exact situation happened to my best friend 2 years ago and it panned out the same way; now they are back together.

I (Male 21 now ) and  this Girl (now female 22) met last summer, hit it off. Started talking and eventually dating even after she left The country to go back to our Home country. Went there this year in feb for Some celebrations and we met up. We talked about “us” and she said that she doesn’t know what she feels(sort of) but right now she doesn’t want s relationship because I’m too far and she doesn’t know how that would work more with our busy schedules. She said she still cares about me just isn’t a good time for a relationship(you know the drill). 
We met up a few times after and she showed some clear attraction still so I figured well I can get her back. (Even told her challenge accepted)

Fast forward to March and she starts giving me one word answers and then just stops talking to me. 
She still likes my IG posts and FB shit and is always the first to view my story. (Friends think she’s doing it so that she doesn’t lead me on from this far or so that I don’t distract her or something like that) I’ve been distracting myself from her by taking to other girls and all that. 
But so the other night she pops into my head out of no where right before I’m about to go to sleep. I was talking to a friend about it and he said I’m in love. Talked to my mom about it(apparently they still keep in touch, awkward) and my mom said she definitely cares about me still.(weird way of showing it) 

But so now it’s almost summer and IM MOVING to the country where she lives and where we are both from. I’ve told mutual friends but not her. I’m sort of terrified to do anything right now.... 

I don’t really know what I want and I don’t know why she just randomly popped into my head. (Another friend thinks Its Becuase Im moving and when her and I were still a thing it was nice to know someone like her was there for me) 

Any insights or tips or anything? This is new turf for me, don’t know what’s happening to me 😬😂

I'm not even sure what I'm asking or if I'm just venting.  This past week, I'm looking through the entire house for part of a remote control. (The ""lost tv remote"" could be an entire thread.  lol).  Anyway, I open up a cabinet and find a box.  Similar to a shoe box but bigger.  Now this box was in the general area of the house but not in a cabinet that's often used.  I open the box up and discover it's filled with cards.  When I fan through it, I quickly realize these aren't cards from me or to me.  (My wife and I are on our second marriages and have been married for only two years after about 2 years of dating).  The amount of cards in the box make it obvious it's not just cards from or for her kids, and it must go back 10 years.  In fact the cover of one made it clear that it's at least 15 years old.  So I shut the box and put it back.  No I didn't read them which may seem hard to believe, but that's just how I am.  Not that I'm too good a person, but that I just can't stand to see that stuff.  I'm the kind of guy that doesn't want to see her facebook either.  I trust her, so I'm not concerned about her cheating, but I just don't need to find myself looking at any posts from guys.

Now back to it.  It kind of puts a knot in my stomach.  I realize women are more sentimental than men, so I probably should've expected it.  In the past, I've asked her to keep all her personal items in her own ""space"" so that this exact thing wouldn't happen.  

Here's the twist.  I'm not really even upset that she has the cards.  What's more upsetting to me is the feeling that she lied about her previous marriage.  We've both (or so I thought) been VERY open about our previous marriages.  There was a lot of similarity to them which I think helped us bond.  (They both became addicted to pain meds).  One thing she always told me was that she just ""settled"" with her first husband.  Said there was never any ""romantic feelings"" but that it was more like just friends getting married.  This also, was similar to mine.  She would go into great detail showing that she never had true love or real romantic type feelings.  This was just through conversation, not be interrogating her.  I was actually very surprised when she told me this.  I had expected (and would've been fine with it) had she said, they had a great relationship, were in love but the pain meds changed him and killed the relationship.  But then I find these cards...   I can't IMAGINE saving romantic type cards from someone that I wasn't ""in love"" with.  I never saved a SINGLE card from my first wife.  The fact that she's kept these cards though out the years (at least 15) tells me there was far more to their relationship than what she led me to believe, even though she didn't need to tell me different. 

So if you are still with me on this...I have found it MUCH harder to handle the deception than I have the fact that she's actually has the cards.  For those of you that'll say ""communicate with her"", I did actually bring it up.  I told her what I found and told her I wasn't mad that she had them.  I just asked that she collect all her private/personal things and put them somewhere where I won't ""stumble"" upon them.  Communication broke down a little bit so we didn't get into my thoughts about it showing more to their relationship and how I felt (unnecessarily) deceived by it.  

Guess if there's a question its, am I wrong to assume that if someone keeps love notes or cards from someone then they obviously had strong feeling for them?

I (28F) have been seeing my now ex? (29M) for about a year. We met online and started off as FWB last June but then feelings developed on both sides and eventually we started dating. Currently, He makes significantly less money than I do and he doesn’t have a car. When we started hooking up, those things didn’t really bother me as I wasn’t having any expectations as we were not dating or trying to date. At the time I was unemployed, which meant having a lot of free time to entertain a guy that I wouldn’t have crossed paths with in my regular working life. He is from the hood and I am from a suburban town so we come from different backgrounds, we couldn’t be more different. 

We began hanging out more and going out to eat and I was ending up picking up the bill more bc I was enjoying his company and he didn’t have enough money at times to cover the bill. In hindsight I know this was dumb/naive as I was already investing more when we weren’t established yet. I just enjoyed his company and he sometimes would go days without eating bc he couldn’t afford it so I would offer us to go out and eat. 

Fast forward to about September where we become more established. I started to start becoming concerned about things. I’d been figuring out plans for us to do activities, usually paying for this activities bc they were my ideas, since he didn’t have a car, I was the one driving to him and picking him up and dropping him off. He contributed when he had the money but that was seldom bc his work schedule isn’t as steady as my M-F 9-5. I was starting to feel frustrated that my effort wasn’t being matched in any level. Ok, he wasn’t financially where I would like him to be, I understood that from the beginning and accepted it but in return all I asked him for was emotional support, acknowledgement and understanding. For some reason he always disputed when I’d tell him “hey, it makes me feel a type of way when you do this” he would Make it seem like it was a problem I had to fix all on my own. He has mentioned a couple of times how he really wants us to get a place together and build upon what we have but a part of me always felt uncomfortable with it bc I know his work status isn’t secure and making that kind of commitment would mean me bearing a majority of the financial risk. He doesn’t have a bank account nor any credit. 

Recently we have been arguing a lot. I have become so exhausted of putting in all the work in the relationship in order to make sure we could make it. My last straw was this past week. It was my birthday and he really showed me where I stood in his life.. he had to work on my bday which he couldn’t control and I was ok with it. But A day after work he wanted to see me. I usually go kickboxing after I get home from the city and he was upset that I wasn’t willing to come see him. I later found out that he had a bday surprise for me. I don’t get how he expected me to realize that without giving me some kind of hint? Lately he’s been dissappointed and frustrated that we hardly see eachother during the week. He works on the weekends and doesn’t get his schedule until the week begins so I never have a heads up on what days he’s off so that I can clear my schedule in order to see him. Is that my fault? I made the suggestion last night that he could take the train into the city to meet me for lunch on a day off so that we are getting some time spent together. He said he wouldn’t bc he thought t was dumb to spend all that time to commute just to spend an hr with me. This made me feel so dumb bc I always make time even after work to go see him when I can even if it’s for a few hrs. He is the one that always tells me that time spent together no matter how long is what’s important. 

So on the commute this morning,after doing a lot of thinking about us, I broke up with him. I don’t feel like he tries to make up for the parts of our relationship where I have to put in more work (paying for dates and driving to and from). When I told him how I felt he only said “OK” . Didn’t offer any solutions or try and reach a compromise. I’ve brought up this conversation before several times and he always answered the same way, “if you can’t handle what is going on with my life, then you should do what’s best for you and leave”. I know he’s right but the way he says it makes me feel like whether we make it or break it is solely dependent on me, that he doesn’t have a part to play in making is work either. So I ended things. This is my first serious relationship and all of this has been new to me in regards to how deep my feelings were and how much I cared for him. I don’t know if I am overreacting or not? I just need some advice.

Please help.,"I've been in a relationship for over a year. We are very serious and in love.  Recently, probably since we have become much more comfortable around eachother, I find myself saying incredibly mean things to her and, not yelling, but definitley rasing my voice.

Doesn't happen a lot, but happens whenever I feel like she has done something uncharacteristically hurtful toward me. For example, we drove 9 hrs to wedding that neither of us wanted to attend. It was her friend, she was complaining about going and i didn't want to go but decided to in the end because she didn't want to go alone and i wanted to support her. This was a pain in the ass 3 day wedding event and we had to spend alot of time and money to get there. Suprisingly, It actually turned out really well. We had a great time until the very last night we went out for drinks with some people. We are Sitting at the table with her and her friend and everytime I try to say something she brushed me off, ignored me or looks at me like I'm an idiot. I know zero people at this weddding and Eventually i am sitting at the end of the table like an ass not talking, because for some reason I feel like my gf is acting too cool for me. I get annoyed and say I'm taking an uber home. She comes with and we argue about why I'm upset and I say some really mean things like, oh you're just like the rest of them, you totally change when your with your friends. You made me feel like an idiot yadda yadda. 

This sounds really lame now that I'm typing it out, but these little annoyances keep turning into heated arguments. I'm just not sure what to do. I feel like I should be more calm and relaxed. I also feel like she needs to own up to some wierd out of character behavior. We are incredibly close and always have eachothers back so I can feel easily betrayed by these little things she does that hurt me. 

Some background, my dad died unexpectedly from a heart attack when I was 23. Never had the chance to say goodbye and this is definitley the root if my anger. Ever since he died I've taken on more of a dont take any shit, don't give a fuck attitude. 

Sorry its convoluted and stupid I'll try to clarify things in the comments, but if something doesn't change I will probably push her out of my life. And I love her.

699,8jdab9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jdab9/am_i_being_too_clingyover_thinking_in_a_ldr/,Am I being too clingy/over thinking in a LDR?,"If I have to ask the question, then chances are that I probably am. But let me give a bit of background:

I’m a 30 year old male in PA, in a relationship with a coworker (35 F) who is located in GA. We’ve known each other for nearly 3 years now. Last October, she came up to PA to see family for the first time since I’d know her, and she worked out of my office. We immediately hit it off and the chemistry that we had over the phone translated instantly in person. By the end of her week long trip, we had sex. We’d admitted we liked each other and wanted to see where things might go.

She came up in December, where we got to spend a bit more time together outside of work. The sparks were still there. It was wonderful. I decided then that I really did want to pursue this and considered moving to be with her. Due to schedules and complications, I wasn’t able to see her until recently. 

I just got back from visiting her in GA two weeks for about 4 days. We had a nice time. I got us a house on Airbnb, we did relationshippy stuff, it was fun. since I’ve gotten back, I feel like things have been different. You know how you can tell when something is different with somebody? That’s what I’m feeling. 

Personally, since I’ve come back, I feel like our communication has dropped considerably. In the months before, we’d text pretty consistently throughout the day. It’s died down over the months (which is natural.. as you just run out of shit to talk about), but since getting back (I feel) it’s nearly non existent. Trying to get her to communicate or hold a conversation is a struggle. I get one or two word responses. We talk on the phone and it’s fine, but romance is seemingly out the window. I’m beginning to feel like if I didn’t make an effort to talk to her, she might not either. 

I’ve made several comments over the last two weeks, telling her that I’ve really missed her since I’ve been back, that I can’t wait to see her again, and a plethora of other sweet, kind or romantic things, and I just get none in response, whereas I would have a month earlier.

I made a comment last night about it and said something like “Can I get some love this week? I haven’t been feeling it lately.” And she responded with “I’ll try. I have class tomorrow though”. I’m sorry, what? She’s going through nursing school and has a 9 am class until 10, then she’s back at work the rest of the day. What does that have anything to do with her being sweet? That really irritated me. It’s not my intention to force someone to display affection they’re not feeling, but come on. That just screams red flag to me.

It just feels like a switch has been flipped and it’s bugging the fuck out of me. I’ve not done a long distance relationship before, but I know they’re hard. I personally feel like communication is currently all we have, and without it, this LDR doesn’t work. It’s going to be long distance for a few more months, so it’s a problem that needs to be resolved. I’m committed to making this work, but I feel like she isn’t right now.

It fucks with my head, because I have those fears of uprooting my life and getting down there, and then being left. I’ve never done this before. I’ve never moved out of state. It’s all overwhelming at times. The last thing I want is to be left hangin down there.

I brought all of this up a few nights ago, as I try to be open and talk about things, and she told me that she didn’t see a difference. That I was over thinking it and that everything was fine.

But it doesn’t feel fine. Something FEELS different. I don’t feel the same warmth from her end. Now I’m caught between not wanting to smother her by being uncharacteristically needy and clingy and just chilling out and hoping things go back to normal. It’s the waiting for things to go back to normal that is the hard part. I just don’t feel confident in the status of our relationship, but I don’t want to alienate her by continually laying my insecurities on her after she told me everything was fine.

I’m over thinking things, right?","['clingy', 'thinking', 'ldr', 'ask', 'question', 'chance', 'probably', 'let', 'bit', 'background', '30', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'pa', 'relationship', 'coworker', '35', 'f', 'locate', 'ga', 'know', 'nearly', '3', 'year', 'october', 'come', 'pa', 'family', 'time', 'know', 'work', 'office', 'immediately', 'hit', 'chemistry', 'phone', 'translate', 'instantly', 'person', 'end', 'week', 'long', 'trip', 'sex', 'admit', 'like', 'want', 'thing', 'come', 'december', 'get', 'spend', 'bit', 'time', 'outside', 'work', 'spark', 'wonderful', 'decide', 'want', 'pursue', 'consider', 'move', 'schedule', 'complication', 'able', 'recently', 'get', 'visit', 'ga', 'week', '4', 'day', 'nice', 'time', 'get', 'house', 'airbnb', 'relationshippy', 'stuff', 'fun', 'get', 'feel', 'like', 'thing', 'different', 'know', 'tell', 'different', 'somebody', 'feel', 'personally', 'come', 'feel', 'like', 'communication', 'drop', 'considerably', 'month', 'text', 'pretty', 'consistently', 'day', 'die', 'month', 'natural', 'run', 'shit', 'talk', 'get', 'feel', 'nearly', 'non', 'existent', 'try', 'communicate', 'hold', 'conversation', 'struggle', 'word', 'response', 'talk', 'phone', 'fine', 'romance', 'seemingly', 'window', 'begin', 'feel', 'like', 'effort', 'talk', 'comment', 'week', 'tell', 'miss', 'wait', 'plethora', 'sweet', 'kind', 'romantic', 'thing', 'response', 'month', 'early', 'comment', 'night', 'say', 'like', 'love', 'week', 'feel', 'lately', 'respond', 'try', 'class', 'tomorrow', 'sorry', 'go', 'nursing', 'school', '9', 'class', '10', 'work', 'rest', 'day', 'sweet', 'irritate', 'intention', 'force', 'display', 'affection', 'feel', 'come', 'scream', 'red', 'flag', 'feel', 'like', 'switch', 'flip', 'bug', 'fuck', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship', 'know', 'hard', 'personally', 'feel', 'like', 'communication', 'currently', 'ldr', 'work', 'go', 'long', 'distance', 'month', 'problem', 'need', 'resolve', 'committed', 'make', 'work', 'feel', 'like', 'right', 'fuck', 'head', 'fear', 'uproot', 'life', 'get', 'leave', 'move', 'state', 'overwhelming', 'time', 'thing', 'want', 'leave', 'hangin', 'bring', 'night', 'ago', 'try', 'open', 'talk', 'thing', 'tell', 'difference', 'think', 'fine', 'feel', 'fine', 'feel', 'different', 'feel', 'warmth', 'end', 'catch', 'want', 'smother', 'uncharacteristically', 'needy', 'clingy', 'chill', 'hope', 'thing', 'normal', 'waiting', 'thing', 'normal', 'hard', 'feel', 'confident', 'status', 'relationship', 'want', 'alienate', 'continually', 'lay', 'insecurity', 'tell', 'fine', 'think', 'thing', 'right']"

Yesterday she told me she’s bi, and that she’s been bi since 8th grade and is just now telling me, it came up because her brother and one of her sisters are gay, so she came out as bi, she says she’s bi because she’s kissed a girl and touched their boobs before and she liked it, and when she told me it made me a bit uncomfortable because all my life I grew up with parents and brothers that were all straight and my pasts ex’s were also straight, so this was new for me.

When I told her that she told me she regrets telling me that because of how it made me feel, I told her that I still will love her and will just need like a day or two to get used to the news, and that it pretty much wont change a thing in our relationship, I said pretty much because it’ll just make me a little uncomfortable is all, and when I said pretty much she got upset and is mad at me now, what do I do?

As a result, we've both agreed to remain friends, and in these last few weeks, we've been crunching out exactly how we want to handle this break up. 

In our talks, there has only been one major disagreement. Whereas I think we should not be talking like we currently do right after the breakup, she wants things to remain exactly the same. In my mind, this is only going to lead to lingering feelings and will make our potentially amicable breakup into something more painful in the long run. Keep in mind, it's not like I dislike talking to her, au contraire; I feel that taking a month or a few months with significantly less talking would strengthen a future friendship.

I guess one important note is that we talked a LOT during our relationship, so I can see where she's coming from. She kind of takes offense that I don't want to talk to her right after, but I am emphasizing that it's not out of negativity.

One side is responsible for my pain. The other side is the reason Im still with her. But the pain in me is becoming so great. Im basically depressed. I always have anxiety. Its all I think about, all day everyday. Seriously. Im consumed by the negativity of the relationship and living in constant fear that Im going lose her. We just cant seem to find peace. The worst part is that she doesnt do this on purpose. She knows its happening and has balled her eyes out before when we've had discussions about me maybe having to leave her because of it. She doesnt understand why her love doesnt come out the way it should sometimes. I think she might just be a selfish person at her core. I dont think she is capable of reciprocating the same love that show her. I dont think Im needy. Trust me, I dont have big asks. Anyways - the pain inside me feels like its consuming me.

The thing is, I am so so scared of ending it. I feel like that will only make it worse. I feel like it would absolutely break both of us entirely. I know it would. Thats the reality of it. And I would hate myself for it. I know that I will face mental turmoil over it for it for a very long time. I dont think I will ever stop loving her, regardless. Ill never 'get over' her. Its so scary. So heart breaking to even think about. We are eachother best friends. Shes all I have. I have my mom and dad and some mild friends but no one really that close. 

I dont know what to do. Im so weak. I just think its time. I struggle to picture marrying her. I dont think shes the right girl for me. But it seems too difficult to do. It seems impossible. I lose my breath just thinking about it. I wanted to marry her... to love her till we're old. Shes my closest friend. How can I proceed? Please help.

(Male 20) (Girlfriend 18)," We are in a long distance relationship where I am in college a rising junior and she is a rising freshman in college. We are high school sweethearts and I started dating her the beginning of my senior year \(so almost 3 years: 2 years LDR and 1 year actually home\) My college is 400 miles away and I am a student\-athlete so coming down to see her is quite the challenge. We text every day and such and face time each other frequently. However, an issue started emerging and it started about 6 months into it. My mom never liked her because we would spend way too much time together. At the time, I didn't think so. But, looking back at it, I do agree with my mom. We were in the honeymoon phase in our relationship. But, my mom felt like my girlfriend was taking me away from her. So, she never really liked her and would always put on a fake face when she was around. Then she would continue to talk shit about her to me behind her back. I always defended my girlfriend because I love her.

Today, I came back from college after a 9\-hour drive and she told me how she felt about it. She has mentioned it before and I would always tell her it would get better over time. However, I think it sparked it recently for her. She assured me I was not the issue, but it was my mom \(she said it a lot better than this\).

I love this girl to death. I would go the extra mile for her. She is my best friend and I am hers. We get along so great together, however, because of my mom's first impression of her was not great. Because we spent a lot of time together and my mom felt like my girlfriend was talking her son away from her.  I understand what my mom is going through because the girl was my first girlfriend so my mom started developing jealousy.

My girlfriend started crying and it broke my heart to see this. She asked what should we do? The only thing I suggested was for us to take a break for a couple of days and think about it. Then, when the time is right, we will talk.

She also mentioned that she is not happy with the relationship because of the stress my mom brings.  I come from the Korean culture so there are cultural boundaries involved.

I need help.  What do you think is going to happen?  It has been three days and I do not know what is to come.  What can I do to fix this problem?  And if there is anything, I need specific help.

I [25M] and my girlfriend [24F] have been together for 2.5 years, and lived together for 1.5 years. I'm moving to another city for a job, and for her to follow me she'll have to give up on her really good job and hope to find something as good. She's more than willing to do this for me. 

I have mixed feelings about letting her do this. The fact is, since we moved in together especially, I just feel kinda bored. I miss the single life a lot. Little things frustrate me. And I feel like shit for it.

The fact is, she's the best girl I've ever met. I remember how excited I was when we first got together, telling my best friend that she was a complete knockout, a perfect 10. And she is. She's beautiful. Smart. Funny. Motivated. We have similar interests and personalities. We live well together. She's neither possessive nor coldly independent. But most of all: she really gives a damn about me. If I have a problem, she'll do anything she can to fix it. 

Despite the fact I miss my full independence, I worry that I'll never meet anyone this perfect for me again. And if I do, I'll just feel the same way eventually. 

I guess my question is, is it normal to feel this way? Is not giving in to the desire to be single part of maturity? Or does the fact that desire even exists mean that I'm not in love, and I should let her get on with her life?","['settle', 'good', 'aspect', 'maturity', 'soppy', 'post', 'crossroad', 'right', 'want', 'know', 'feel', 'normal', '25_m', 'girlfriend', '24_f', '2.5', 'year', 'live', '1.5', 'year', 'move', 'city', 'job', 'follow', 'good', 'job', 'hope', 'find', 'good', 'willing', 'mix', 'feeling', 'let', 'fact', 'move', 'especially', 'feel', 'kinda', 'bored', 'miss', 'single', 'life', 'lot', 'little', 'thing', 'frustrate', 'feel', 'like', 'shit', 'fact', 'good', 'girl', 'meet', 'remember', 'excited', 'get', 'tell', 'good', 'friend', 'complete', 'knockout', 'perfect', '10', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'funny', 'motivated', 'similar', 'interest', 'personality', 'live', 'possessive', 'coldly', 'independent', 'give', 'damn', 'problem', 'fix', 'despite', 'fact', 'miss', 'independence', 'worry', 'meet', 'perfect', 'feel', 'way', 'eventually', 'guess', 'question', 'normal', 'feel', 'way', 'give', 'desire', 'single', 'maturity', 'fact', 'desire', 'exist', 'mean', 'love', 'let', 'life']"

710,8jcj77,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jcj77/i_37f_am_in_love_with_so_40sm_who_has_no/,I [37F] am in love with SO [40sM] who has no intention of marrying me. Do I stay?,"I am here to garner some perspective from the Reddit universe to see if I am actually right in my thinking, or I need to get a grip and be happy with what I have.     

**TL;DR**: *SO was married before. Doesn't want to get married again. I've never even been engaged and desperately want the whole shebang - proposal, wedding, marriage. Do I leave SO and live in hope that it may happen with someone else, or do I stay with SO, knowing that I will never get what I have always wanted?*          

**Background**: I've been with my SO for a number of years now and he is the best person I've ever known. He is everything I could have hoped for BUT for the fact, he is divorced and has made it clear that he will never get married again.    

I'm not your typical ""dreamt of a white wedding from the age of 4"" girl - I'm very independent and it took a lot to even move in with my SO. I've not had a lot of relationships at all and was single for about 5 years before meeting SO, but I always assumed or hoped that I would naturally meet someone who would turn out to be the love of my life. They would propose to me and we would get married (like all my family and friends have done). To be honest, I would be happy eloping to Las Vegas and doing it in front of Elvis so it's not for the sake of a wedding day.       

I'm sick of seeing engagement posts on social media and knowing I'll never get to feel that special that he chose me... I know it's only a piece of paper but his whole family are married (multiple times in some cases), as are all of my sisters. I want to feel special and I want to feel wanted - I want to feel *chosen*. It kills me that someone else got to be proposed to by my SO. It kills me that someone else got to call themselves his wife.      

People can live lovely, full lives without that piece of paper but it seems that the families I am in (mine and his) have a strong emphasis on marriage and how you're not truly 'one of them' or part of the family until there's a ring on your finger. It is like a slap every time someone asks me when we're getting married and I have to say we're not, or if someone mistakes us for husband and wife and I have to correct them.     

In my mind, it also epitomises just how special you are to that person. He could propose to me with a candy ring and I would cherish it - the fact that he would propose would just be the highlight of everything.     

I suppose what I am asking is - do I stay with my SO, whom I love, knowing that I will never get the proposal/marriage that I have always wanted but because he's such a great man I should be happy with what I have?  Or do I leave him and live in hope that I might meet someone as equally amazing who wants to marry me and I get that extra bit that I've always wanted?       

[Note: I know it may not last forever and be for life, and divorce rates are high these days, but it really hurts knowing that I've never been special enough to someone that they wanted to propose.]","['37_f', 'love', '40sm', 'intention', 'marry', 'stay', 'garner', 'perspective', 'reddit', 'universe', 'actually', 'right', 'thinking', 'need', 'grip', 'happy', 'tl;dr', 'marry', 'want', 'marry', 'engage', 'desperately', 'want', 'shebang', 'proposal', 'wedding', 'marriage', 'leave', 'live', 'hope', 'happen', 'stay', 'know', 'want', 'background', 'number', 'year', 'good', 'person', 'know', 'hope', 'fact', 'divorce', 'clear', 'marry', 'typical', 'dreamt', 'white', 'wedding', 'age', '4', 'girl', 'independent', 'take', 'lot', 'lot', 'relationship', 'single', '5', 'year', 'meet', 'assume', 'hope', 'naturally', 'meet', 'turn', 'love', 'life', 'propose', 'marry', 'like', 'family', 'friend', 'honest', 'happy', 'elope', 'las', 'vegas', 'elvi', 'sake', 'wedding', 'day', 'sick', 'see', 'engagement', 'post', 'social', 'medium', 'know', 'feel', 'special', 'choose', 'know', 'piece', 'paper', 'family', 'married', 'multiple', 'time', 'case', 'sister', 'want', 'feel', 'special', 'want', 'feel', 'want', 'want', 'feel', 'choose', 'kill', 'get', 'propose', 'kill', 'get', 'wife', 'people', 'live', 'lovely', 'life', 'piece', 'paper', 'family', 'strong', 'emphasis', 'marriage', 'truly', 'family', 'ring', 'finger', 'like', 'slap', 'time', 'ask', 'get', 'marry', 'mistake', 'husband', 'wife', 'correct', 'mind', 'epitomise', 'special', 'person', 'propose', 'candy', 'ring', 'cherish', 'fact', 'propose', 'highlight', 'suppose', 'ask', 'stay', 'love', 'know', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'want', 'great', 'man', 'happy', 'leave', 'live', 'hope', 'meet', 'equally', 'amazing', 'want', 'marry', 'extra', 'bit', 'want', 'note', 'know', 'forever', 'life', 'divorce', 'rate', 'high', 'day', 'hurt', 'know', 'special', 'want', 'propose']"
711,8jcete,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jcete/cant_tell_if_girlfriend_f_19_losing_interest_in/,Can't tell if Girlfriend (F 19) Losing Interest in Me (M 20),"Hey, sorry if this post is to rambly, but I don't know who else to talk to about this. I am just completely confused, and want to also specify this is my first relationship and which is also why I am seeking help. 

Now to begin our relationship going into its 6th month, and her birthday is this coming weekend. I'm even going by train 5 hours to visit her for it and to meet her parents, but for a while I have felt like either she is putting in no effort or has lost interest in me. I really want to continue this relationship but am honestly at a loss what to do. 

I say this because whenever we have talked, since around 3 months ago, we have always talk about her day and then sometimes get to mine only after exhausting the conversation about hers. I'm going through a rough patch too currently and it would help for me to talk to her about my day. 

Now I have told her twice before that it would mean alot to me to talk about my day, and how that talking about things helps me clear my head. But still unless we talk about her day fully and I then respond with one worded responses about X topic, prompting her to ask about my day, will not get asked. By text or voice calling.

When I told her last time that I feel she wasn't asking alot about my day and how that bothers me, she accused me of saying that she wasn't putting enough effort in and got quite offended. I then said that I know she is putting in effort, and getting better at asking about my day, which at the time she was. However I feel it's ridiculous to say she is putting in effort just by asking how my day went. I just feel that if she has to put in effort to ask about my day it shows how little she cares about me and this relationship regardless of the fact I'm going to visit her for the weekend. 

So I guess my question is: does her lack of asking about my day consistently, show a complete lack of effort or interest in me, and if does or doesn't, how should I proceed? I really want to continue this relationship but have no idea how to proceed either way. I have tried communicating the problem to her but she hasn't really responded to it besides in anger, which I feel is rest  unwarranted. I would appreciate any advice from people who have experienced a similar situation, or just advice in general on relationships. 

**TLDR** Can't tell if girlfriend (F 19) is either putting no effort into relationship or has lost interest in me (M 20) . For months had made little effort to ask about my day or how I'm doing, and when I communictaed how I was feeling she said she was ""putting in effort"" and got quite angry.

But she still wants to be with me. What should I do?,"I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 years now, we were doing well when she lived in the same country as I. We were in love, we had small fights here and there but we always patched up the same day.  She moved in to my place and we were happily living together. Until about a year ago she was told to leave the country, due to her complicated immigration application. There were lots of emotions the day she left, we promised to each other we will work hard at our relationship and we will be there for each other, I told her I would come see her and we will beat the odds and make the long distance relationship work. Things were absolutely fine until about 3 months ago when I visited her. When I went to see her, she was acting weird towards me, expecting lots of cuddles and love making, I got nothing. After I came back, a week later, things started looking bleak, I was emotional and I still missed her and wanted to be with her, she told me the same thing but she stopped text me as much as she used to, she says that she is busy trying to make money. She is a singer, she is working on building her YouTube channel and at night time she goes out to bar, while at the same time studying for SATs. She is residing now in China and I am all the way in North America. She texts an older gentlemen, who lives in the same city as I do and happens to be my boss, she asks him to give a visit to her, she told me he is just her friend. She only texts me when she needs help, and for the last two weeks she has exchanged only 15-30 texts with me, while she has been video chatting and texting with my boss. Sends him her photos and asks him to visit her. I am growing uncomfortable, and jealous at work. Jealousy was an emotion I never used to feel before, now I do. She tells me I give her the reason and the motivation to fight and work hard, so we can be together. Her life has been screwed up because when she was told to go back when she was entering college here and now China apparently doesn't support the preliminary education from here, she was told to repeat high school in China before she can enter into college and she doesn't want to do it. Her dream has always been to go to college, she now has decided to prepare for SATs and study in US. I even proposed to marry her so we can be together and live together again but she declined due to money reasons. She told me that I was not her priority anymore, she wants to focus on studies and her music career, it broke my heart. But she says she still wants to be with me.

Question is, what should I do? Trust her and just wait for her SATs, make enough money? I don't want to leave her when she needs me, I have been helping her edit and upload videos on YouTube, she says if I won't do it, she wouldn't be able to show her talent.  

OR

Completely end things with her?  Please help.

tl;dr: Been in a relationship with this girl for 3 years, she had to leave the country, started long distance relationship, things recently started looking bad for our relationships, she video chats with my boss more than she texts me. Wants to study, focus on music and tells me I am not her priority. But still wants my help and wants to be with me. What should I do?  

UPDATE: I made this post yesterday and just a day later, after seeing the unanimous support for completely ending things with her, I am going to proceed with calling her and ending this relationship.

Hubs did nothing for Birthday, anniversary or mother's day.","Ok, first let me say that my hubs is an absolutely amazing man and father but sucks at gift giving, always has. I've also made it clear that I'm not into big lavish gifts. 
Here's a quick timeline because it's gets insane. 
His bday 4/16
Anniversary 4/18
My bday 4/19
Sons bday 4/19
I got him a $60 smoker attachment for his grill, he had been talking about getting one for a long time. BAM, happy birthday love! 
He, in a car ride up to my parents to celebrate our son's first bday, starts looking for my gift, it is now the day of my bday. He picks out an $80 lable maker... I like lables but I do not need a freaking $80 lable maker. I can also tell he's put no thought or time into picking something out so ya bummer there. Still no bday gift to this day.
I get a ""happy anniversary"" the morning of and that's all, which is ok the smoker was a bundle gift. We're on a tight budget while he's on hiatus.
Mother's day comes up and we have a noon wedding to attend that's over an hour away. He bails three days before and I have to find someone to go with me last minute and stays home with our son. He did make me breakfast and say happy mother's day (nothing out of the ordinary, he loves to cook) he also makes me dinner (also not out of the ordinary). No card, no note, nothing. Nothing from our son or anything. 
So I start to feel a little bummed and I just keep getting more and more frustrated. Now I'm getting petty mad, now I'm in such a bad mood even the sappy FB posts from other husband's and baby daddy's are making me want to cry. 
I feel really underappreciated but also feel I don't have a right to feel that way. I'm a sahm and he works his ass off, 14 hour days. But when he's on hiatus he's home cooking and cleaning and helping me with everything. I don't even have to ask. All of a sudden the kitchen is clean and dinner is on the stove etc...
I'm still salty and want to talk to him without hurting his feelings. He's very sensitive! So I know this might turn into me comforting him for feeling like a bad husband, which he's not but ya sensitive man. So how do I go about talking to him without hurting his feelings, the last thing I want to do is make him feel bad.

tl;dr husband didn't get/do anything for my birthday, anniversary or mother's day.

I said we should play a game where we ask questions about ourselves to the other person and if they get it wrong they have to take off a piece of clothing. We have hooked up before so I have seen her body before so i figured she'd be cool with it which she said she was. It got to the point where she took her pants off but covered her underwear with a shirt and then when she took her shirt off she covered her boobs the whole time and would not let me see anything. Im not sure if she's self conscious or what but I've seen her body before and i always tel her how beautiful it is. She started to change the subject from the game to other stuff so i eventually got frustrated and kind of stopped talking as much so she ended the facetime to go to sleep. Was i rude? Should i send her an apology text about being stand off ish? I just don't get why she is so nervous to show me. Ive literally hooked up with her multiple times and her body is incredible.

717,8jc5o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jc5o0/last_year_i_fell_in_love_with_a_girl_i_confessed/,"Last year I fell in love with a girl. I confessed my feelings to her. Haven't had much contact since, but now she seems to want to renew our friendship, and I don't know what to say to her.","I'll try to keep the background information short: In September 2016 this girl and I started in the same class in highschool. We and another guy I'm gonna refer to as Bob became pretty close friends. We laughed all the time and had *such* a good time together. I realized as time went on that she was the most beautiful, friendliest, happiest and all around most perfect human being I had ever met. In May 2017 I fell in love with her.

I was so obsessed with her and my only goal then was to tell her how I felt for her, as I couldn't stand the thought of not seeing her her for the whole summer. I also knew that she was changing class next year and I didn't know how much I would see her, if at all, at school. I told her how exactly how I felt (in person) at the end of May, and looking back I feel there is not a single thing that I regret more or feel more ashamed of than telling her and in the way I did (I felt that way just a few weeks after I told her, when my feelings had faded.).

Anyway, she took it quite well, told me she mostly felt sorry for me but that she still wanted to be friends. Summer break arrived and we exchanged like 5 messages. I tried telling her to listen to my favourite song, but she would not answer that. I greeted her a happy birthday a month later, she would not answer that either. Her excuse a day later was that she had not used her phone or texted anyone at all latley.

Since the new school year started I usually saw her like 1-2 times a month, and I was to scared and ashamed of talking to her. She usually said hi (very happily) and I would mumble back a ""hi"" and dissapear from view. A week before christmas she suddenly came from nowhere and began talking to me and two other classmates she knew from last year. She seemed happier than she usually was. 

In February this year she posted a picture on social media of her doing something she had previously told me she wasn't a fan of. I saw my opportunity and I asked her why (private text message). She answered and gave a follow-up question (which she had like never done via text before), and then came another question, related to my answer, and then another. Out of nowhere she just said ""btw, I listened to that song you told me about and it was really good."" I was too happy to just have a conversation with her to realize how weird it was that she hadn't told me that earlier. I should have asked why she told me now... Anyhow, she kept the conversation going by just keep asking questions and suddenly we had sent 20 or so messages. Then it just kind of stopped. Was this conversation because of sympathy or because she actually wanted to talk to me and know the answer to all these things? I want to belive in the latter but I'm not sure.

Didn't really see her after that, until last Tuesday. That day she sent a picture in an 11 month inactive snapchat group consisting of just me, her and Bob. Me, Bob and a few other classmates decided Tuesday morning to walk around the school in the sunshine. *She* had seen us from inside a classroom and sent a picture of her being excited over seeing us, or something. I couldn't come up with a response. Later at lunch she came to the lunch queue at the same time as me and some of my classmates. She was in the front and I in the back, but I'm pretty sure she didn't look at me.

**My thoughts about what she thinks:** From what it seems like, she doesn't want to just start a conversation with me (maybe it's too awkward or she's scared of what I think of her now?), but will happily talk or message me if I break the ice first. 

So, I want advice on what to do, what to write to her, anything that helps me stop this weird silence between us, because all I want in this world is for her to know much I regret everything and for us to be (real) friends again. How do I start a conversation (via text) with her? Do you agree with my thoughts on she wanting to renew our friendship or do you see it another way? 

Thank you for taking your time reading.

**TL:DR** This girl I confessed my feelings to a year ago goes from being the friendliest person to pretty much ignoring me back and forth. We have not had much contact for the past year, but it seems like she wants to become real friends again now.

Dan and her had something not really labeled so I didn't let that hold me back because I've never felt this way. 

Dan left for a trip for 4 months or something like that and in the meantime I've never been happier, we have a great time, her friends like me, nice dates, great sex, you know felt like a swell time. 

Dan comes back and she starts doubting, as soon as I see that, I decide that we should stop it. I did this out of pride, I was afraid she would get back with him regardless so I wanted it to be my choice. Skip two, three months further and she's back with him and this time for real. I try to move on, have a nice time with a couple of girls but nothing I actually cared about. 

Now a couple weeks ago I run into her again, we get to talking and she asked me if she could spend the night, she said she forgot her key but I know she has a lock with a numbercode on her frontdoor so she doesn't even need a key. I tell her she can but she's not getting any of this sweet sugar, I do this to protect myself from feelings. 

Skip forward a week or three, Dan and her broke-up, we're having sex and I feel like I'm setting myself up for another heartbreak. My brain tells me to abort but she makes me feel all fuzzy inside.

My question, Should I move on without her or should I give it another chance?

12 years. I messed up 2 years ago and stepped out of the relationship. 

My wife doesn’t think I want to be with her now and has dreams about the affair. I’m trying to help her through it and ensure her that I want to be with her. Obviously she still has trust issues and I don’t blame her that she does. 

About 3 years ago I was getting depressed and was great at hiding it which I’m not proud of. My emotions started to build up and I started acting out and taking it out on my wife which is unacceptable( not physically just not giving her my attention). 

During the affair I was getting depressed even more because I knew I messed up. After she found out I had suicidal thoughts because I don’t know how I could do this to the person I love. 

My wife put me in a psychiatric hospital and I was there for 4 days and I felt better because I was able to express my emotions to somebody the whole time. 

2 months later my wife got pregnant and our daughter is amazing. 

My wife is still struggling and I really want to help her but I don’t know the right things to say or do. My wife is an emotional person and I’m not the person to express my emotions often and when I do it’s anger because I’m mad at myself for doing this to my wife. 

Please help I really want to save my marriage and make it better than it has ever been. Please if someone has some good advice I will do anything to help my wife.

We agreed that we show love and affection in different ways, and it being the reason why can't both of us be happy. So we broke up. And it hit me hard, not being with him, not having him as a part of my everyday life, it is hard. I still love him and miss him, but I know that he is not willing to change and because of that I am forced to live my life without him. 

But, we remained friends. And last night we went out for the first time since we broke up, my BFF and him. It was hard to look at him and not being able to kiss or hug him as I did before. But even harder was being by his side while he was looking at his phone and constantly texting another girl. I was on the edge of tears. He noticed, and insisted that I tell him what's going on. I refused, but he continued asking me, saying that he cares too much to see me like that, and wants to know the reason why I'm sad. I didn't want to tell him, because I knew it would only feed his ego. I'm sure he wouldn't do anything about it, telling me we're no longer toghether and that I now have no reason to be unhappy.
Since I refused to confront him, saying that he shouldnt care any longer, he told me that he will always care for me, because he loves me in a way that can never stop. He then hugged me and left. 

I got home in tears. I had a really bad night. 
He is supposed to come today to help me with some work around the house.

Should I talk to him?
Is there anything I can do just to stop feeling this pain when he is around me?

I’m dating a girl right now who I like, but if I were to describe her it would be “utterly clueless.” Let me explain.

I met her in an uber pool and we went on an impromptu date immediately and clicked. She is sweet, kind, passionate about her work, and objectively a total hottie. I mean she’s a knockout that turns heads everywhere she goes (and also gets recognized because of her modeling work with someone famous). Because we’re a really interesting looking couple, we get a lot of attention whenever we go into social settings simply because of our aesthetic (an attractive interracial couple). This is where her cluelessness becomes an issue though: she is completely unaware of her surroundings in public.

I didn’t assume this would be a bad thing, but she’s also an introvert and does weird things openly and publicly. She’s goofy in a hokey way, will walk right through a group of people minding their own business, and talks extremely loudly about sensitive subjects. It’s as though she has the awareness of a child, as she never stops to consider where she is and who is around her—no matter what the situation. She is very inexperienced in life (was a virgin for a long time), whereas I am the complete opposite.

There’s also the matter of her hygiene, as I’m fairly certain she has a yeast infection and has no clue about it. I don’t know how to bring this up with her in a gentle way, other than suggest we both get tested since we’re starting to see each other. If she’s this careless about her own body, I’m concerned with how this extends to other parts of her life.

When I introduced her to my friends, she had no problem talking with a mouthful of food and didn’t listen to conversations—responding with “huh?” or “what’d you say?” halfway through a topic. And when walking somewhere in an open setting, she has the tendency to walk behind me instead of next to me... like a child trailing behind a parent.

She’s only four years younger than I am and has been living on her own for the past 6. She’s from the rural midwest and is thoroughly a gentle sweetheart, but I honestly think that her obliviousness to the world around her could be a potential liability.

I’ve never been the type to want to change a woman, as it seems controlling and disrespectful. But this is the type of girl who could easily be taken advantage of. As someone aware of the dangers of the world, I feel like I almost need to explain these things to her on an hourly basis.

So /r/relationship_advice, what do you think? Should I cut her off or take her under my wing?","['date', 'clueless', 'crosspost', '/r', 'dating_advice', 'date', 'girl', 'right', 'like', 'describe', 'utterly', 'clueless', 'let', 'explain', 'meet', 'uber', 'pool', 'go', 'impromptu', 'date', 'immediately', 'click', 'sweet', 'kind', 'passionate', 'work', 'objectively', 'total', 'hottie', 'mean', 'knockout', 'turn', 'head', 'go', 'get', 'recognize', 'modeling', 'work', 'famous', 'interesting', 'look', 'couple', 'lot', 'attention', 'social', 'setting', 'simply', 'aesthetic', 'attractive', 'interracial', 'couple', 'cluelessness', 'issue', 'completely', 'unaware', 'surrounding', 'public', 'assume', 'bad', 'thing', 'introvert', 'weird', 'thing', 'openly', 'publicly', 'goofy', 'hokey', 'way', 'walk', 'right', 'group', 'people', 'mind', 'business', 'talk', 'extremely', 'loudly', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'awareness', 'child', 'stop', 'consider', 'matter', 'situation', 'inexperienced', 'life', 'virgin', 'long', 'time', 'complete', 'opposite', 'matter', 'hygiene', 'fairly', 'certain', 'yeast', 'infection', 'clue', 'know', 'bring', 'gentle', 'way', 'suggest', 'test', 'start', 'careless', 'body', 'concerned', 'extend', 'part', 'life', 'introduce', 'friend', 'problem', 'talk', 'mouthful', 'food', 'listen', 'conversation', 'respond', 'huh', 'halfway', 'topic', 'walk', 'open', 'setting', 'tendency', 'walk', 'instead', 'like', 'child', 'trail', 'parent', 'year', 'young', 'live', 'past', '6', 'rural', 'midwest', 'thoroughly', 'gentle', 'sweetheart', 'honestly', 'think', 'obliviousness', 'world', 'potential', 'liability', 'type', 'want', 'change', 'woman', 'control', 'disrespectful', 'type', 'girl', 'easily', 'take', 'advantage', 'aware', 'danger', 'world', 'feel', 'like', 'need', 'explain', 'thing', 'hourly', 'basis', '/r', 'relationship_advice', 'think', 'cut', 'wing']"
724,8jbebt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jbebt/22m_my_girlfriend_20f_was_taken_advantage_of_i/,[22/m] My girlfriend (20/f) was taken advantage of. I don't know what to do.," So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year and half. My girlfriend is very emotional, she would cry over little things and she constantly wants my attention but the thing is I would take her our, bring her to my place, talk to her on the phone for hours. As time went on, we would get into really bad arguments, it would get to the point where she'd hurt herself or threaten that she'd go kill herself and she would say things like I only use her for her body. I love her and I want to make things better for us but sometimes I just can't take it anymore.  

 So recently we were just on the phone talking I don't know how it led to this but she asked "" How many kids do you want?"", I replied "" I don't know, it's too early for that."" She got mad and hung up. I also thought that was rude of her so I never called back, then she started calling me back but I never answered until the 50th missed call. We kept on arguing until she said she had something to say that happened when she was 15. She told me she would send nudes and webcam to people and that there was this one guy who blackmailed her saying that he would kill himself if she stopped. She told her mom and her mom didn't say or do anything about it. This continued until she was 19 or until she met me. I told her that none of this was her fault and that she was taken advantage of. For a girl that age to have dealt with this by herself, I told her to go seek help and that I would go with her if needed be.
Can someone please give me advice?  


I love her and I want her to be happy. 
My heart hurts and I want to cry, I have no one to talk to about this.

Try to make this as short as possible, ive never been in love and consider myself a fuckboy. But when i met the girl im currently dating i fell for her instantly. So we've been dating for like two months, we've had sex multiple times but im super stressed. I really want to continue this relationship but she does not want to rush into anything. She cares about me alot and vice versa..

I feel like i need conformation before i can cool down, i also feel like this is my last chance to find someone like her and who lives closeby. Family wise we get along very good and her dad knows my dad so theres a connection there aswell. Right now she is having her exams so she is quite busy, and i can understand that. 

On the other hand lets take an example, i asked her if she wanted me to come over the other night, but she became super hesitant and didnt feel like replying to my question. So i asked her later about it, and told her she couldve just said no instead of not replying. And her response was that she wanted me to come over, but then again didnt. Because if we were together to much in the beginning our relationship would become boring according to her. And of course she didnt want that neither do i. So, i dont know what to do, im stressed out, and i cant seem to relax. Maybe i should just end it? I asked her if she wanted to put us on hold and maybe wait a little bit, but no she didnt want that either... i feel like everything i do is wrong and this is going to shits and i always have this little thought in my head that she is going to break my heart so fucking bad....

TLDR at the bottom. 

So we talked about things over the phone and I decided to give it one more try. I went to see her in the end of April and the week was just great. We had fun, went to bars, drink with her friends... over the weekend we went to Paris, things just seemed to be back to normal. She promised me she learned her lesson and wouldn't do anything silly. 

I returned home and we would talk over the phone again every day about our days and would chat via text messages during the day. I just couldn't wait for her to come home next week. 

Then saturday she went out with friends. They ended up pretty wasted and when I called her sunday morning, she was really hungover. She even had to hang up because she thought she was gonna throw up. 

When I asked her about the evening she started acting suspicious. She said they drank wine at her place and then just went to a night club and ordered a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of cola and drank that. No dancing (she really sloves to dance, which was suspicious) just sitting in the night club and talking. The thing that bothered me the most was the fact, that she took 2 or 3 seconds to think about every question about the night before. So I asked her if the other guy went out with them. She said yes. I ask her what they were doing. She says nothing, again after 3 seconds. I tell her she acts very suspicious and to tell me if she did anything. She ends up admitting they made out in the club and she even let him put his hand in her panties. She says she's sorry but I just don't believe I can let this one slip. 

So I guess that's it then. 6 years of our lives wasted. Thrown out the window for an hour of pleasure. I can't believe I was such a fool to really think she would change. I wasn't even gone for two weeks. 
It's gonna be hard. Finals are coming and I just can't stop thinking about it. But I'll cope. 
I thought the thing we had was actually love but I don't believe love can do that...

[TLDR: I went to see her, things were great between us. She promises there's nothing to worry about. Less than two weeks after I went back home, she hooks up with the guy in a night club.]","['update', '26_m', 'feel', 'crush', 'girlfriend', '24_f', 'action', 'feeling', 'original', 'post', 'https', '//www.reddit.com', 'r', 'relationship_advice', 'comments/8cxql5', 'i_26_m_feel_crushed_by_my_girlfriends24_f_actions/', 'st', '=', 'jh62n78h&sh=0fa73491', 'tldr', 'talk', 'thing', 'phone', 'decide', 'try', 'go', 'end', 'april', 'week', 'great', 'fun', 'go', 'bar', 'drink', 'friend', 'weekend', 'go', 'paris', 'thing', 'normal', 'promise', 'learn', 'lesson', 'silly', 'return', 'home', 'talk', 'phone', 'day', 'day', 'chat', 'text', 'message', 'day', 'wait', 'come', 'home', 'week', 'saturday', 'go', 'friend', 'end', 'pretty', 'waste', 'call', 'sunday', 'morning', 'hungover', 'hang', 'think', 'go', 'to', 'throw', 'ask', 'evening', 'start', 'act', 'suspicious', 'say', 'drink', 'wine', 'place', 'go', 'night', 'club', 'order', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'bottle', 'cola', 'drink', 'dance', 'slove', 'dance', 'suspicious', 'sit', 'night', 'club', 'talking', 'thing', 'bother', 'fact', 'take', '2', '3', 'second', 'think', 'question', 'night', 'ask', 'guy', 'go', 'say', 'yes', 'ask', 'say', '3', 'second', 'tell', 'act', 'suspicious', 'tell', 'end', 'admit', 'club', 'let', 'hand', 'pantie', 'say', 'sorry', 'believe', 'let', 'slip', 'guess', '6', 'year', 'life', 'waste', 'throw', 'window', 'hour', 'pleasure', 'believe', 'fool', 'think', 'change', 'go', 'week', 'go', 'to', 'hard', 'final', 'come', 'stop', 'think', 'cope', 'think', 'thing', 'actually', 'love', 'believe', 'love', 'tldr', 'go', 'thing', 'great', 'promise', 'worry', 'week', 'go', 'home', 'hook', 'guy', 'night', 'club']"
729,8jax7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jax7b/my_24f_boyfriend_26mwas_seeing_someone_for_the/,My (24/F) Boyfriend (26/M)was seeing someone for the first two months of our relationship and told me she has just his friend..,"This will be a long one but ***please,*** stay with me as I am desperate for some advice.

I met my current boyfriend in Ireland while he was travelling here from Germany in November 2017. We met on Tinder and we spent his whole trip here \(only 3 days\) but we had a seriously good connection and two weeks later I was on a flight to Germany to see him again. We had an incredible weekend where both us said how amazing the connection was between us and that there was no way we could end this. I flew home the Monday and the following Sunday there was a girl in his Instagram stories..she was out drinking with him the night before and was in his that morning baking, listening to music with candles lit. I unfollowed him and texted him explaining why I unfollowed him cause he gets incredibly  anxious. He's got crippling anxiety btw.  I told him that its totally fine for him to be dating other people but that I didn’t want to have to look at it. He couldn’t believe that I thought he was that sort of guy and said he’d never do something like that to me. He told me she was a really good friend and nothing more. The next day he commented on her photo calling her beautiful so I messaged him and asked why he was calling his friend beautiful and leaving love hearts on her photo and he said it’s just a German thing and I naively believed him. For the following six weeks she showed up on his social media at least once a week and he always reassured me they were friends and nothing more but I never really believed it and thought maybe she wanted more but that he didn’t. By new years we were official and by February we had said I love you. Here’s where it gets messy. This weekend I was in Germany and I found loads of photos of them on his laptop \(I wasn’t snooping..I was working from his PC and they were all over the desktop\) And I asked him again and he denied it again and what unravelled after this has left me in complete shock. The girl he told me for months was a good friend was actually a girl he had been dating. It was only casual cause she wanted it to be. He asked her to be his girlfriend. She said no. It took him about six hours to tell the whole truth and I had to drag it all out of him with the information the girl gave me. It is hard to explain the extent of his lies but he created an entire story just to hide this one big secret. He had me change his bed sheets the day I was leaving cause my perfume made him miss me but it was actually so she wouldn’t smell me. He had my visits planned when she was out of town. He told me every time I asked that she was his very good friend and nothing more. Then suddenly he said she tried to kiss him but he didn’t kiss back. Then he did kiss her back. Then they had sex once. Then they had sex a lot. Then he finally admitted that they  had a casual relationship with dates and everything. She broke things off at Christmas and at New Years he made things official with me which makes me wonder was I just second best? He maintains that I wasn’t and he just didn’t know what to do cause he was scared about the long distance and completely doubted it. He had no job and I have very little time off work. The girl herself has said they were by no means in love and he was just lonely and wanted someone. He’d text her constantly in front of me and he’d never text me when with her. He once ignored me for two days when I asked him to talk about her cause I didn’t like how insecure she made me feel saying he was busy when in fact he was with her. That killed me. He is truly sorry. I’ve never seen a grown man cry like that and he really did fall apart when I told him it was over. And I can understand why he lied but that doesn’t me I excuse it. We had only met twice and he wasn’t sure we’d ever live in the same country. I don’t speak german and he couldn’t get a job in Germany never mind in Ireland. He had no money and didn’t want to be alone so panicked and lied cause he knew I’d walk away if he was already dating someone. But his lies were cold and calculating and Im too exhausted to get into it all but basically this one lie snow balled and he seemed to master covering it all. He has been the perfect partner since we became official except that even after she left his life and I’d bring her up he’d still deny anything happened and admitted that if I didn’t text her to find out what happened he would have taken the secret to the grave to avoid hurting me. When he found out I texted her for the truth he also rang her and asked her to lie and say they were only ever friends.

I've been back in Ireland a week now and all he as done is send a few texts. He told me he'd do anything to get me back yet hasn't done anything.

**My questions are**: Will he change? Can I trust him again? Or is this kind of lying just simply unforgivable? Am I an idiot for even thinking of going back to him?

A few years ago my girlfriend and i brought a friend into our sex life..

After a few sessions he seemed to not want anymore so we looked around for another person and finally found someone and things were just amazing..
After a year we ended up moving in together. However the 3 somes stopped and these days its just them.
He works away 4 weeks on and gets 1 week off.
The week he is home she spends pretty much every night with him.. they have sex most nights but sometimes not.
She comes into see me in the morning after..
Whilst he still says he is single we all do everything together... she loves him and i reckon he loves her however hes been hurt before so wont open up like that.
She wont let me get someone for fun...

She knows I'm on reddit a lot. A little bit ago she and I had a big fight. It didn't end well and it quite honestly felt like we were gonna break up. We've had a few spats here and there but this one was bad. Won't go into too much detail but we were both at fault. Though she's immensly stubborn and will never admit it. I know that sounds like a dime a dozen type of thing but it's quite true with her. Regardless of that I truly do love her.  

Since that happened we've been somewhat reavalutaing everything between us. I promised I'd change some unsavory personality traits (can be snappy at times) and she agreed she would stay and see what I can do. She doesn't want to leave either (to my knowledge at least) due to everything we've been through and have had so far. The issue I'm having is a certain person she's been chatting with. 

Now hear me out, I know I know, jealous boyfriend yadda yadda. The thing about is that I've known of the guy before. She and him have know each other for a while. What she claims is friends and will never be more. She talks with him quite a lot and I never minded it. However for the last week she's been going about it differently. Usually if she's txting him or anyone she'll do so and if she gets up from the bed or wherever she is she usually leaves her phone there and even doesn't care if I go through it. However recently, not only has she been taking it everywhere she goes, when we're laying together and she gets a txt from him, she'll swipe it off her screen immediately. And I mean immediately. Like no time delay or nothing, she is all over that. Then she will move away from me and respond to the messages or go to the bathroom or something for a long period of time to do it. 

Just because it's been bothering me I'll try to sneak a glance at the screen passively, just out of the corner of my eye. And I see him sending her 3 or 4 different messages at a time almost a paragraph or 2 in length each. Then she sends a paragraph back. I went to kiss her goodnight (this was earlier, about 30 minutes ago) and when I put my hand on her I felt under the covers that she was holding her phone and she gripped it tightly. He (the guy) lives a bit from us but recently she's been going out a few times and has made a trip to visit him and his family a couple of times now. 

When I txt her to see if she's okay I don't hear from her for several hours (something we agreed we'd never do. Always let the other know you're safe) and then suddenly she's home. She also wanted to make it apparent that she removed the picture of us on her phone's background. Showed me the new background she had and was like hey isn't this cool, pointing the screen at me like she wanted me to understand what she was showing me.

I guess what I'm asking is should I be worried? Should I talk to her about this? Am i just overreacting? Or is she just mad with me still and I should just give her space? I'm sorry if it feels like I just ranted on and on. I've had this on my mind for a while and I felt like I just needed to vent it a bit. I still love her very much, but recently it's felt like she's the one that's giving up now. Even though she's the one that said she never wanted to give up. I just want somebody else's opinion on this.","['23_m', 'girlfriend', '23_f', 'hide', 'throw', 'away', 'account', 'know', 'reddit', 'lot', 'little', 'bit', 'ago', 'big', 'fight', 'end', 'honestly', 'feel', 'like', 'go', 'to', 'break', 'spat', 'bad', 'detail', 'fault', 'immensly', 'stubborn', 'admit', 'know', 'sound', 'like', 'dime', 'dozen', 'type', 'thing', 'true', 'regardless', 'truly', 'love', 'happen', 'somewhat', 'reavalutae', 'promise', 'change', 'unsavory', 'personality', 'trait', 'snappy', 'time', 'agree', 'stay', 'want', 'leave', 'knowledge', 'far', 'issue', 'have', 'certain', 'person', 'chat', 'hear', 'know', 'know', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'thing', 'know', 'guy', 'know', 'claim', 'friend', 'talk', 'lot', 'mind', 'week', 'go', 'differently', 'usually', 'txte', 'get', 'bed', 'usually', 'leave', 'phone', 'care', 'recently', 'take', 'go', 'lay', 'get', 'txt', 'swipe', 'screen', 'immediately', 'mean', 'immediately', 'like', 'time', 'delay', 'away', 'respond', 'message', 'bathroom', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'bother', 'try', 'sneak', 'glance', 'screen', 'passively', 'corner', 'eye', 'send', '3', '4', 'different', 'message', 'time', 'paragraph', '2', 'length', 'send', 'paragraph', 'go', 'kiss', 'goodnight', 'early', '30', 'minute', 'ago', 'hand', 'feel', 'cover', 'hold', 'phone', 'grip', 'tightly', 'guy', 'live', 'bit', 'recently', 'go', 'time', 'trip', 'visit', 'family', 'couple', 'time', 'txt', 'okay', 'hear', 'hour', 'agree', 'let', 'know', 'safe', 'suddenly', 'home', 'want', 'apparent', 'remove', 'picture', 'phone', 'background', 'show', 'new', 'background', 'like', 'hey', 'cool', 'point', 'screen', 'like', 'want', 'understand', 'show', 'guess', 'ask', 'worry', 'talk', 'overreact', 'mad', 'space', 'sorry', 'feel', 'like', 'rant', 'mind', 'feel', 'like', 'need', 'vent', 'bit', 'love', 'recently', 'feel', 'like', 'give', 'say', 'want', 'want', 'somebody', 'else', 'opinion']"
732,8jaocj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8jaocj/girlfriend_sending_nudes_to_someone_else/,Girlfriend sending nudes to someone else,"Precursor; the title isnt exactly correct in the sense that my girlfriend is a Nude model so it's not entirely uncommon for her to have/send/use nudes, but this particular instance is different to me, and I really need advice.

Another precursor; It was 2am and I was going through all kinds of anxieties and I just caved and went on my girlfriends phone, I hate that fact, I have even openly said to her that people who go through other peoples phones are crazy as fuck... and here I was at 2am.

This 'escapade' begins about a week ago, as I've already mentioned my girlfriend is a art nude model (No open leg or porn, it's generally very artsy, and for the record, I LOVE it), she also has an onlyfans page where she posts her modeling pictures, this is great as she not only gets to do what she loves, but she can also make a pretty penny off the back of it, I again have no issue with this. However... A guy messaged her regarding a sponsored shoot, he had an idea in mind and wanted this to be done with her, 2 other art nude models and a photographer of his choice in a location of his choice, (now this isnt that uncommon and is also great) so details are being worked out, the guy has now paid in full for the photoshoot awaiting the date and it all to be organised.

 The guy isnt English and doesnt have the best English in the world, he messages my girlfriend daily (from what I gather), last week we were out on a family outing celebrating a special family birthday, he apparently kept nagging her and nagging her on the day, so she gave him a 'generic' out of office reply and signed it with ""management"", quite a smart move in my opinion to just get him to leave her alone for the day as we all try to relax.

He responded very upset as ""I thought this was a private message between just us to, you have upset me very much"" or something to that effect, when she told me this, huge alarm bells started to ring for me that this guy was a huge creep, so I just wanted to read over a few messages, so as my girlfriend was telling me about it I gestured towards the phone and asked if I could see the messages, mainly as a passing statement, but she glossed over it entirely and pulled the phone away. 

That last part is what I have been hanging on for over a week now, was it a simple mistake that she had just not really heard/understood what I said? Did she truly not want to break her promise to the guy that it was a private message between them two?

So last night hit, I was up late trying to learn a few extra things for some projects I'm working on, 2am hit and I go to get into bed and I move the covers to see her phone is on the alarms screen, without even really thinking about what I was doing, I essentially turned into a dick. I went over to the messaging platform and scrolled through the messages, I didnt even really know what came over me, I just needed to put my mind at rest.

Unfortunately what I saw has only made me feel sick to the bone, shaky, shit etc etc.

No part of me thinks going through her phone was okay, but I did it, the guy does have some VERY broken English and one message he kept repeating was ""Can you send me gift?"" Basically he wanted a private message nude, this is something my girlfriend and I have spoken about for her onlyfans and we discussed it at great lengths, as far as I am concerned, modeling pictures, professionally taken images for the purpose of art are VERY different to naked selfies privately sent to someone.

One is for the purpose of art, the other is very intimate.

After a LOT of bombarding from him, she finally sent him a nude selfie. When I came across it, I literally felt sick to my stomach. 

Now don't get me wrong, I honestly feel like she just did it to shut him up, but as far as I'm concerned, that's really not the point. It's not like I think she's having any affair with this guy or is unfaithful to me in any way shape or form. 

So after I saw this, I also headed over to her onlyfans, and some of the first images I saw were selfies. The thing that really upsets me about this is the fact we spoke about it, and we said behind the scenes selfies were cool, but if it was just going to be a ""I'm at home selfie"" we would at least talk about it.

Now after going over that idea in my head, I'm trying to figure out if I'm being a controlling arse hole for not wanting her to post selfies from home but ones on shoots are okay? It's a mind fuck for me honestly, I love this girl so much.

Now honestly the onlyfans ones bother me a whole lot less than the private messaged one, but they still annoy me, because we actually spoke about that exact scenario and said we would discuss it before she would put anything like that on there, we didnt.

Finally, the last thing that has really upset me, she also sent him a few others that expired after a certain amount of time, so I'm not exactly sure what they were, but one other didnt expire and it was basically the same image she sent me, that made me feel sick to my bones.

Please call me out on all of my bullshit, I know I am not without fault, but I just need advice, I essentially cried myself to sleep last night.

I (22m) have been in a relationship with my ex (21f) for 1,5 years before breaking up with her. The reason why I broke up is actually a long story, but to summurize it, we had fights on a weekly basis and she was really jealous. 
Right now me and my ex are still talking, but she is claiming that I never really loved her, because I was able to break up with her. She says there is no circumstance that you'll be able to break up with a person if you truly love someone. In her opinion you should always keep fighting to improve the situation and solve it.
I dont think this is true, because I was really in love with her. I'm actually still in love with her right now. However I do think those feelings became less, because of the fights and jealousy. And me just being a rational person thinks its better to break up if you have fights for more than 6 months on a weekly basis and there is no improvement. Also those fights had a lot effects on all my goals. I wasnt really myself anymore and couldnt focus on college.

What do you guys think? Because I was able to break up with her and because my feelings for her became less during all the fights, does that mean I wasnt really in love with her?","['love', 'hello', 'reader', '22_m', 'relationship', 'ex', '21_f', '1,5', 'year', 'break', 'reason', 'break', 'actually', 'long', 'story', 'summurize', 'fight', 'weekly', 'basis', 'jealous', 'right', 'ex', 'talk', 'claim', 'love', 'able', 'break', 'say', 'circumstance', 'able', 'break', 'person', 'truly', 'love', 'opinion', 'fight', 'improve', 'situation', 'solve', 'not', 'think', 'true', 'love', 'actually', 'love', 'right', 'think', 'feeling', 'fight', 'jealousy', 'rational', 'person', 'think', 'well', 'break', 'fight', '6', 'month', 'weekly', 'basis', 'improvement', 'fight', 'lot', 'effect', 'goal', 'not', 'anymore', 'not', 'focus', 'college', 'guy', 'think', 'able', 'break', 'feeling', 'fight', 'mean', 'not', 'love']"

While there, on a dating app, I made a connection with someone whom I shared a lot of interests with, much more so than with many guys I talk to.

The area I'm from is fairly conservative and not open-minded, and thusly has a much smaller pool of men to date. On top of my certain nerdy interests, it makes it difficult to connect with people on all cylinders.

Enter this guy. Our first date was hours and hours of nearly uninterrupted conversation about our interests while we visited the area. At this point during my trip, I had already decided I would be moving there (before I went on this date). He acknowledged that, and the date ended a little abruptly due to some time constraints but on a fantastic note.

Queue the texting. Things got a bit heated, and the conversations got a little deeper. At some point, he talked about how he hasn't dated for a long time and I let slip that neither have I, and we both had some trust issues. Then, at least I feel, fucked up big time. I told him that this may be the strongest connection I've ever had with a guy.

What I meant to articulate, I realized later, was the strongest connection I've ever had with a guy this early in getting to know them. I somehow missed that connotation, and during that conversation he began to withdraw. I realized I must have been a bit too extreme about it, somehow, and gave him some space.

I didn't hear from him for a couple of days, texted that I hoped he was doing well. Another day. He tells me that I made him extremely nervous, and that due to some bad shit going on in his life he's dealing with he wasn't in the right head space to talk about it. But didn't want to disappear.

I start, of course, telling him how I respect that and totally understand. I wasn't thinking about what I was saying. Another sentence or two and I realize, in my head, I'm attempting to explain myself. And then, of course, he's not ready. I apologized and told him to just contact me when he's ready to talk and would give him space until then. 

I feel there were a myriad of misinterpreted things in what he may have gleaned from what I said, and I don't want to completely blow it because I -do- feel a strong connection with him. He just may think it's much more consequential and serious for me than he's imagining. He may also see my general demeanor as cloying or fake, as he has trust issues, when I'm just sometimes overly honest.

Is there anything I can do to salvage this other than to just wait patiently, if I haven't totally fucked it up? And when he talks to me, what should I say? I feel like explaining myself only seems like excuses or fakery. I care for this guy and feel we'd be great together, and don't want to come off as too aloof or nonchalant, but at the same time not smothering. I have a strong feeling someone will sweep him off his feet with their much more refined social skills, and I'm out of sharing a great relationship because I wasn't proactive enough with explaining myself.

But if I text him again, I feel like that would simply end anything we could have. Advice? Thoughts?

EDIT: He explained to me that he wasn't sure what he wanted, and that I respected that, but hoped if nothing else we could stay in contact for now, and he agreed. I'm not trying to get married straight out of the gate or anything, and if he doesn't want a relationship, I can handle it. It just feels scary being completely in the dark on how I should proceed. Don't want to be too nonchalant, don't want to come off as needy.","['30', 'm', 'totally', 'screw', 'start', 'relationship', 'amazing', 'guy', '32', 'm', 'scare', 'away', 'recently', 'visit', 'city', 'recently', 'large', 'diverse', 'culture', 'bit', 'different', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'date', 'app', 'connection', 'share', 'lot', 'interest', 'guy', 'talk', 'area', 'fairly', 'conservative', 'open', 'minded', 'thusly', 'small', 'pool', 'man', 'date', 'certain', 'nerdy', 'interest', 'make', 'difficult', 'connect', 'people', 'cylinder', 'enter', 'guy', 'date', 'hour', 'hour', 'nearly', 'uninterrupted', 'conversation', 'interest', 'visit', 'area', 'point', 'trip', 'decide', 'move', 'go', 'date', 'acknowledge', 'date', 'end', 'little', 'abruptly', 'time', 'constraint', 'fantastic', 'note', 'queue', 'texting', 'thing', 'get', 'bit', 'heated', 'conversation', 'get', 'little', 'deep', 'point', 'talk', 'date', 'long', 'time', 'let', 'slip', 'trust', 'issue', 'feel', 'fuck', 'big', 'time', 'tell', 'strong', 'connection', 'guy', 'mean', 'articulate', 'realize', 'later', 'strong', 'connection', 'guy', 'early', 'get', 'know', 'miss', 'connotation', 'conversation', 'begin', 'withdraw', 'realize', 'bit', 'extreme', 'give', 'space', 'hear', 'couple', 'day', 'texte', 'hope', 'day', 'tell', 'extremely', 'nervous', 'bad', 'shit', 'go', 'life', 'deal', 'right', 'head', 'space', 'talk', 'want', 'disappear', 'start', 'course', 'tell', 'respect', 'totally', 'understand', 'think', 'say', 'sentence', 'realize', 'head', 'attempt', 'explain', 'course', 'ready', 'apologize', 'tell', 'contact', 'ready', 'talk', 'space', 'feel', 'myriad', 'misinterpreted', 'thing', 'glean', 'say', 'want', 'completely', 'blow', '-do-', 'feel', 'strong', 'connection', 'think', 'consequential', 'imagine', 'general', 'demeanor', 'cloy', 'fake', 'trust', 'issue', 'overly', 'honest', 'salvage', 'wait', 'patiently', 'totally', 'fuck', 'talk', 'feel', 'like', 'explain', 'like', 'excuse', 'fakery', 'care', 'guy', 'feel', 'great', 'want', 'come', 'aloof', 'nonchalant', 'time', 'smother', 'strong', 'feeling', 'sweep', 'foot', 'refined', 'social', 'skill', 'share', 'great', 'relationship', 'proactive', 'explain', 'text', 'feel', 'like', 'simply', 'end', 'advice', 'thought', 'edit', 'explain', 'sure', 'want', 'respect', 'hope', 'stay', 'contact', 'agree', 'try', 'marry', 'straight', 'gate', 'want', 'relationship', 'handle', 'feel', 'scary', 'completely', 'dark', 'proceed', 'want', 'nonchalant', 'want', 'come', 'needy']"

I really do. We’ve known each other for years and we have been best friends for a long time. 

That being said, I don’t feel like the two of us being together is what is best anymore. I love her, but not in the way one loves a romantic partner. I love her like a close friend. I’ve felt this way for months, but haven’t really known how to bring it up. We had a rough patch a few months back where we would argue often, and I honestly thought I would end up letting it slip during a fight, but things have gotten better since then. 

I feel like I should mention that my main concern is her mental health. My girlfriend has a nice collection of mental illnesses inherited from both sides of the family, so I worry that she won’t take it well and she’ll enter a depressive state that she might not break out of for a long time if ever.

Will I just have to stick it out so she can be safe?

On good weeks, we’ll have sex about 4/5 days out of the 7. Of course, this “statistic” (if you will) wouldn’t apply to the weeks we aren’t together, for example, during breaks (summer break, winter break, etc). When we first started having sex, we would always use a condom but one night we started talking about what it would feel like to not use a condom. In my previous relationship, my ex would never put a condom on and would constantly tell me that he doesn’t like using condoms because it takes away a lot of the pleasure for men. Me, being the passive person I am, didn’t say anything against it and always just trusted him to pull out (he was also my first so i just trusted him more bc he claimed to be “experienced”).

Anyways, relating this back to my current relationship, I told him basically how i’ve had unprotected sex before and he said “really?” and i told him about my previous relationship. Again, I trusted my current boyfriend to just pull out and ever since, we’ve been on and off with the condoms...mostly off because he likes the feeling of them off since sometimes in certain positions, the condom just rubs weird on his dick..idk how to explain it but it becomes uncomfortable for him. I don’t like knowing that sex isn’t as pleasurable for him when he has a condom on because then i don’t feel good when we’re having sex knowing that he’s not enjoying it as much. Another thing, with the whole “trust system” i start getting really anxious the days/weeks after we have sex because i start to convince myself that I’m pregnant cause of different factors. Like when I start getting hot easily or breaking out more often, i’ll look the symptoms up and 10/10 times something always comes up saying i’m pregnant but then a week later, I’ll get my period and i’m relieved. That is, until i have unprotected sex again. We’ve had to buy plan b a couple times because of certain mishaps.

So we’ve talked about me getting birth control before..a lot and don’t get me wrong i WANT to get birth control so bad but i’m just terrified of my parents finding out cause i feel like it would come up on the insurance bill or something.  My parents are very conservative and don’t believe in sex before marriage. They also don’t support contraceptive use so if they find out i’m using birth control behind their backs, they’d be pretty upset and start putting pieces together. I’ve thought about just telling them that i need it for bad periods or something like that if they ever found out, but i KNOW they wouldn’t buy it because 1. I didn’t tell them about my horrible periods before i got on the pill and 2. they just wouldn’t buy it in general. 

So I just don’t know what to do because my boyfriend keeps pushing me to get on the pill but i’m too afraid to since i don’t want my parents finding out if i ever do get on it. I hate being anxious every time I have sex and it would kind of be the end of the world if I did end up being pregnant. Please help :(

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have unprotected sex quite often and he pushes me to get on birth control. I want to as well but am terrified of my parents finding out through the insurance bill or something since they are hella conservative and would lose all trust in me. Parents also don’t support the idea of birth control.

He was sweet, but had quite a temper and spoke his mind a lot, which is something I appreciated a lot even if my friends didn't like it. I always thought he was the greatest guy. And... I'll admit I liked him a lot, like, a lot. I'm gay, and he was openly Bi.

And last year, me and him started hanging out a lot more. I remember he used to fight with a lot of my friends, but I didn't care, he was fun to talk to in the end of the day. I found out that he already had someone. It was a girl; and to make it all worse, it was a big friend of someone I knew. I never dreamed of interfering in their relationship though, and I hoped they'd be happy together.

So, me and him started really hanging out a lot more, until he eventually decided to sleep at my place.

I'm not even sure how to explain it but it was one of the best nights of my entire life, and I don't mean it in a fully sexual way, I mean it was one of the most fun nights in ALL THE FUCKING ASPECTS, he was so nice and funny and at the same time he gave me so much attention and even bothered to ask what I liked, just to then do it PERFECTLY for me, he was so fucking amazing. I loved every little bit of it.

And then the morning came, and he left, and I woke up, and I felt like absolute shit when I realized I had just laid down with someone who already had a partner. He told me his girlfriend didn't mind him being with other people, and I found it weird at first but I just... I had never felt that way about anyone, he was so perfect, I just needed more of him in my life.

I just loved every single night I spent with him more than anything, he was so unique in every aspect. It was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I loved talking to him and cuddling with him and doing about ANYTHING with him. And in this one night, he told me in like the most adorable gentle voice that he liked me and that he wasn't happy in his relationship and wanted to be with me instead. I WAS SO HAPPY, LIKE, OH MY GOSH. And even so I just said I'd think about it.

And then the realization came and hit me in the face. He wasn't in an open relationship, and his girlfriend didn't even know about any of this.

I didn't do anything though before I asked my friend (the one who was close friends with the girl) about it and she confirmed to me that his girlfriend never told her anything about being in an open relationship. At that moment, I freaked out. I had no idea what to do so.

Sooo I just did the first thing that came to my mind. **TL;DR:**

He tried cheating on her by being with me, and I got nervous when I found out, didn't know what to do, felt like a big asshole as if I was the reason why he was cheating, and... I told her that me and him had a thing. Better saying, I told my other friend who was best friends with that one girl, and she told her.

**MOST** of my friends didn't like him, so I had QUITE A LOOOOOOOOT of motivation to tell, my friend was all like ""YEAH DUDE GO TELL ON HIM HE'S A BITCH YOU CAN DO IT GO DUUDE!!"" and I thought it'd be the right thing to do after all. 

And the outcome is obvious; their relationship was over. And so was my friendship with him. But I doubt he ended the friendship because I ruined his relationship; I think he ended the friendship because I kinda ""betrayed"" him in a way by telling her. I broke his heart. God, I'm such a fucking asshole. 

I MISS HIM SO FUCKING MUCH. LIKE, SO FUCKING MUCH. OH MY FUCKING GOD I MISS HIM

He was the sweetest guy, even if he could be a little aggressive towards me sometimes and had his own angry moments, but regardless, he was one of the only people who ever seemed to really care about me and give me attention. I don't care if he just wanted to fuck or whatever, I STILL LIKED SPENDING TIME WITH HIM and I miss it so much, even with all the questionable things he'd tell me and with how wrong it all was I liked his sorta douchebag-ish act. No, scratch that. I absolutely fucking loved it.

And now he doesn't even wanna speak to me. He avoids me at all costs and it hurts so much, but I can't blame him. I feel so awful. And the funny thing is, all of those ""friends"" that encouraged me to tell on him barely talk to me now, they're too busy with their new friendships. I've been completely ditched out. And I miss him even more now, you have no idea.

Noone has ever shown that much care towards me since then except for my best friend, NOONE seems to even care about how I feel or care about making me feel comfortable like he did, My fucking god, it was such an enormous mistake. I hate myself so fucking much for this, like, you guys have no idea how much I want to die right now. I ruined a potential relationship with the only person who seemed to care about me just because I thought I would be ""doing the right thing"", oh my fucking god.

We both fully believed we were soulmates and planned on being together forever, so we decided to be exclusive despite me going out of state for college. 

He recently became very unhappy with my communication and broke up with me in January. Since, then we have not talked at all which has been the longest we've ever gone without talking (we were friends before we ""dated"" and even talked through most of our ""off"" periods), so I have really felt his absence in my life. 

After our breakup, I was in denial that we were really over. As I mentioned, we were friends before we ""dated,"" meaning that we've been talking for about 6-7 years. Immediately after the breakup, I told myself that I would get him back and had planned to write him letters of our best memories together. I wrote one and sent it (in February), and he gave me positive feedback. However, I was caught off guard shortly after when he started posting pictures with a new girl (33/f) in March. I was heartbroken all over again. I know a good amount about her because she is in the same friend group as my ex. She is basically a replacement of myself, sharing many qualities and interests as me. She is also a recent divorcee (married in June 2017)...

Throughout my hardest academic semester, I have been processing my emotions about all of this. My plan had been to write my ex a letter, but I'm not sure if it's too late? It's been 5months since we broke up. He has since traveled with his new girlfriend and posted many recent pictures with her. He seems really happy, but I am still so heartbroken and in love with him. I never got a chance to fully express my thoughts about the end of our relationship as it was happening. I really do believe he is the love of my life, and I don't want to lose him. Is it worth writing a letter at this point? The purpose would be to tell him how I felt about our relationship (positive) and to gain closure.

I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years now and this Instagram model thing has always been a problem for me. I used to think that I was just super insecure and that him liking pictures of half naked girls he didn't even know didn't actually mean anything. But this wasn't the occasional liking of a random IG model picture. He followed so many of them and basically left a ""like"" on every single one of their pics. When I confronted him about it he really didn't think there was an issue and said that if I were to do the same with guys I follow it wouldn't bother him. He said that he would stop but after like a month he began to do it again and I did the stupid thing of going through his phone and found that not only did he like those pictures, he would also screenshot and save them to his phone, DM them to himself, and even sent them to his friends and say very objectifying things about those women. I told him I looked through his phone because there was no way I was not going to confront him about that. He agreed to stop that behavior. 

Fast forward to a couple days ago, I got suspicious that he was doing it again and he in fact was still sending them to his friends and his recent searches were all instagram models. I don't understand the fascination/obsession with them?? I have told him time and time again that I feel very disrespected by his behavior and he says he understands, or at least lies about it, but he does not truly see anything wrong with it. It's one thing to follow these girls he's never going to meet but to constantly look them up and send them to his friends is disgusting to me. He's disrespecting me in front of his friends and since they send him pictures back, it shows me that his friends don't have respect for me either. I truly believe it's an obsession if he agreed to unfollow all of them to avoid this problem with me but still be searching them just to look at their profiles.

745,8j9sml,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j9sml/having_zero_experience_is_preventing_me_from/,Having zero experience is preventing me from getting any experience,"Hi, so I'm 23 and have been struggling to connect with anyone at all once they find out that I've never done anything with a woman.

I've connected with about 6 women the past 5-6 years and its the constant theme that they all get intimidated by the fact that I'm a virgin, never kissed anyone never done more then hug the opposite gender. But I can't ever get anywhere because that's where things end up stopping. I recently lost the chance to be in a relationship with a girl because I'm a virgin and she said its too much pressure for her to be the one to do it for me and that its extremely intimidating to her, and shes not the first. I don't like lying but it seems like it's my only option.

Not that I can get any women to go after me anyway, I'm the guy that women and people in general go to when they need something but couldn't be bothered to be there for me. I'm not the best looking guy out there but I'm by no means ugly. I'm just worried about being alone forever at this rate. Any advice?

I think it was the biggest mistake of my life, and I want to tell her, but she doesn't want to talk to me. I'm respecting her wishes, but I still think she'd feel differently if we did talk.","**TL/DR**: Broke up with my girlfriend almost 3 years ago. I still regret it. Subsequent life experiences have helped me realize how priceless of a connection we had. I recently asked if we could get coffee to talk, and she said she was trying to move on and didn't want to. I'm obviously respecting her request, but I can't help but think things would go differently if we actually met face-to-face and I was able to tell her how I feel. I know she still cares about me, and I'm pretty sure we both feel like we haven't found anyone who comes close to as good of a match in the last 3 years. 

I'm expecting most people will say ""Don't contact her. She's moved on."" That's what I'm planning to do. But after these 3 years, I do still badly miss her, and part of me feels like that same feeling is still dormant in her, but she's burying it out of fear of getting hurt again. She doesn't know the extent to which I feel like this. Not trying harder to talk to her about this almost feels like giving up too easily on the potential love of my life. On the other hand, contacting her further at this point might reasonably be interpreted as desperate, unwanted pestering -- if not harassment.

Just wondering if anyone has perspective they'd want to share. I've been in my head with this for the past 3 years.

**Full story, for those interested:**

Like the title and TLDR says, I broke up with my ex 3 years ago. I'm still regretting it, and I still feel like we'd be happier together. We were together for 3 years, and had the healthiest, most supportive relationship of my life. Long story short, I ended things for two main reasons: 1) I was getting impatient with her being in a bit of a rut for the entirety of our relationship (living with mom, unhappy at a retail job while slowly getting her degree, mild depressive episodes, etc.); 2) As a guy who had always jumped from one long-term relationship to the next, I felt like scratching the itch to be single and date around while I was still in my 20s. 

The breakup devastated her. We had started making plans for the future (marriage, kids), and I pulled the rug out from under that. Since then, I have scratched that itch by dating a few dozen women, and I had another 1-year relationship that ended 7 months ago.

Here's a long, sappy timeline of events:

* Dated for 3 years. Normal ups and downs, but overall a super positive, loving, committed relationship.
* Broke up. Lots of tears.
* We stayed ""friends"" who checked in on each other. I started dating other people and having that kind of fun I had been craving. She remained hopeful that we would get back together.
* 6-7 months after the breakup, I started to realize that dating around wasn't fulfilling to me. I was having fun, but I missed her so damn much. I told her I had made a huge mistake and couldn't see myself with anyone but her. She had started to finally get over me, but cautiously agreed to see me.
* We started from square one, very slowly dating again. It felt amazing -- like everything was working out and going to be OK. I was totally focused on her.
* About a month into dating again, we slept together and both said ""I still love you.""
* The next time I saw, I found out she had started seeing another guy who she had just met on Tinder. She slept with him for the first time *the day after she slept with me*. I was really hurt and upset, but told her that we could make it work if she just cut him out of the picture. She said she couldn't decide and thought she needed to be single and date around for a while.
* I. Was. Crushed. But as bad as it hurt, I couldn't blame her. I screwed things up first.
* A week later, I made a Hail Mary: We met up and I explained how I knew she was the person I wanted to marry. I wanted to keep supporting her through her frustrating rut, be there for her graduation, and essentially just love her for who she is because at her core, she was the one for me.
* She essentially said that she couldn't trust me to not break her heart again. She didn't want to take the risk with me a second time. ""Sorry, I'll always love you, but no.""
* Devastated, I spent the next 6 months doing things to try and stay positive. I made major upgrades in my career and fitness, with occasional spurts of dating that never went anywhere.
* 1 year after our breakup, I contacted her to see if we could get coffee and catch up. We had a really good phone conversation and she agreed pretty happily to see me. Then I asked if she was still seeing that guy, and she got kind of quiet and said that she was. My heart dropped. I said ""Sorry, nevermind. I still want to be with you, so I can't do this if you're still seeing him."" She said ""OK, I understand."" We never met up.
* A few months later, I met someone I actually really liked, and things developed into a serious relationship.
* A few months after that, 3 different friends told me they saw my ex back on dating apps. (I wish they hadn't said anything, but this news did tell me that she was single again.)
* My new relationship lasted a little over a year, until this past fall. It ended relatively amicably. For my part, I was acknowledging to myself that this relationship wasn't as good as my previous one with my ex. I had zero contact with my ex throughout the duration of this newer relationship.
* A few months later, I dipped my toe back into online dating, and almost immediately saw my ex on a dating app. I swiped right. We did not match. I checked her Instagram, and in the past 3 years, she had not posted anything with a love interest since me -- including never having posted anything with that guy she had been seeing. I could be wrong, but I have the impression that she hasn't had a serious, committed relationship since me.
* I reached out to my ex via email, saying that it would be great to see her and catch up, because we last saw each other in person on such a bad note 2 years earlier. I said I thought it might be good for us both to see each other smiling and interacting in a more positive light
* She took about 5 days to respond, and essentially said ""Uh, sure, if you really want to...""
* Because of her obvious hesitation, I said that it was OK if she didn't want to see me. Then I explained that my previous relationship had ended, that I didn't think I was completely over her, and that I just wanted to have a candid conversation about it to see if we might be on the same page. (In retrospect, I think I overshared with too much emotional stuff, but I foolishly erred on the side of being totally frank and open.)
* She essentially told me that she had moved on, and that the stuff I said was emotionally disruptive and confusing.
* I kicked myself for dumping too much emotional baggage on her, and said ""OK, thanks for letting me know. We don't need to meet up if you don't want to. Take care.""
* She said ""You too. Seriously, take care of yourself.""
* That was about 6 months ago, and we've had zero contact since.

Personally, I feel like I'm in a good place. My career is better than ever, my social life is decent, I'm relatively happy, and I get dates regularly with women I'm interested in. Still, part of me feels like I'm wasting time that I could be investing in a life with my ex. I just want a chance to look her in the eye, see each other laugh and smile again, tell her how I feel, and see what she says. Interacting in person adds so much humanity to a situation that you just don't get via text and phone. But at this point, I fear that any further contact would border on harassment. I'm not planning to reach out again.

I'm comfortable with the idea of moving on. I think I can find that kind of love again. I'm just wondering if I'm giving up too easily. She is free to contact me if she ever wants, and she has made it pretty clear that I shouldn't contact her.

For anyone who has read this far, **THANK YOU**. I appreciate the chance to unload to strangers about this. I would also appreciate any perspective on the situation, or any advice on trying to move on from some serious, enduring heartache. (I'm fully expecting a chorus of ""Move on and leave her alone,"" but that's still worth hearing, too.)","['31', 'm', 'break', 'ex', '26', 'f', '3', 'year', 'ago', 'think', 'big', 'mistake', 'life',

I had one past relationship that lasted around half a year in college, and he had one past relationship that lasted \~3 years in high school.

A couple of days ago, my new\-ish boyfriend of around a month revealed to me that he wasn't a virgin. I'm still a virgin, though I did fool around in my past relationship. We were both raised sort of religious \(Catholic\), so despite him being a 3 year relationship in high school, I guess the fact that he wasn't a virgin came as a little bit of a surprise. I told him I was fine with it, but the next morning I was having some insecurities. I explained the situation to three of my best friends and they calmed me down, knocked some sense into me, and convinced me to talk to him about it. I did, and now everything is perfectly fine and the insecurities are no longer there.

Yesterday, he told me that he never really told anyone except his brother and me about his virginity status, as it was really personal for him and he regrets what he did \(his ex had pressured him into it before he was ready\).

My best friends and I tell each other a lot of details about our personal lives, so I guess I thought discussing the issue with them was fine. I now realize I probably shouldn't have told them about my boyfriend's past. Do I tell him that I revealed his secret? Or should I just keep my mouth shut?

He couldn't bring himself to tell his family that he was coming to my ceremony and his family ended up booking an engagement party for his sister on the same day. My graduation was in the morning and the party was at night. Still, he couldn't bring himself to make it. To make matters worse, he didn't even congratulate me on graduating. So I broke up with him for that and because this wasn't the first time he's missed out on supporting me with a big event

His family didn't like me because they are very traditional and don't like a woman with my sort of independence \( educated, works, lives alone, supports herself\) although he didn't mind this himself. I value myself enough to not be with a man who cannot stand with me in front of his family. However I still feel so hurt by this. He promised me in the beginning of the relationship that he would fight for me no matter what and I believed him. He told me he was crazy about me and that he loves me...the moment I said I love you back everything changed between us and this happened.

A little background about my roommate.  We have known each other our entire life but have never been particularly close apart from partying together. We grew closer towards the end of high school due to a shared loss of a mutual friend.  We would hang out whenever I would be back for breaks because I went out of state for college initially.

Fast forward to now I come to find out he is very narcissistic and manipulative person, one of many problems. His cleaning is nonexistent and expects me to do all of it, have talked to him about it but doesn’t care (found out that changing the cleaning habits of a person is very hard if not impossible). Never contributes food wise which we agreed we would (his idea) both eat our food if we provide, he has maybe brought groceries in twice all year but still eats my food.  Avoids me to avoid conversations so don’t see him often.  However, the main problem being I got a DUI because of him (I have taken responsibility for my actions), he skipped out of being a dd for the fourth time (which maybe could have prevented my situation), I drove (which I shouldn’t have) and got pulled over and you know the consequences that come with.  I come home after being jailed for the weekend and he is acting angry towards me because of the situation (I assume because he knew our relationship would never be the same.)  Always acted very rude after that. Try’s to one up me every opportunity he has, don’t have time for this pettiness. 
Communication has been pretty much nonexistent I say “hi” to him every time I see him to be the bigger man and since we still live together but he ignores me which I am ok with because I have completely detached at this point from him.
So, I would like to ask him to move out.  Our lease is up at the end of July, it’s just us two in the apartment. Not really sure how to ask him to leave, have not contacted the leasing office yet but I know we would be happier apart. Also just received a text from him today. The first saying “Are you living here or moving different places for next year?”…I responded by saying “I’d like to talk to you about that this week.” (I will call my roomy J). J responds with “I’m for sure staying here another year so let me know if you’re staying too or if I need to fill the room” …I did not respond because I want to talk to him, I would assume from the text messages he wants to stay and find someone else.  Any tips to start a conversation with a hostile, defensive and aggressive roommate?  What will happen to the apartment if no conclusion between us?

Im not putting these here for sympathy  I'm just trying to give everyone an idea of all the contributing factors of our problems. 

I'm so mean to this poor guy... I recognize it after the fact more and more ive been noticing *i'm* the one in the wrong more soon after the argument but even then it's still technically too late.

I know how this sounds, but I got pregnant before we really knew each other (we had only been together a few months). But even before then I did my best to suppress my anger until after maybe the first year and then it gets a lot more difficult to recognize and control, I guess? (Forgive me if this is rambly, its difficult to explain) I know it was wrong not to let him know about my anger problems in advance. I did try to warn him of a lot of my other problems but they were basically shrugged off. 

Every single time I get in a relationship with someone I'm very  timid but it's like I file away every single flaw I notice in their personality for later in the relationship. I did this with my husband. I did idolize him and let a lot of things slide. After a while though a bunch of tiny things he did boiled to the surface. If he complained too much, if I found his attitude to whiny, if I was mad about he greeted me when I came home after seeing my friends. After the first time I exploded some years ago these little things would make me go from 0 to a huge overblown argument in seconds! 


I don't think we've gone a single night without an argument in maybe a year or more! I know I'm mean to him, I understand that he's scared to talk to me and I want to change that but I get so angry that he feels that way and I want it to change but I feel completely powerless to fixing it.

My husband is a very sweet guy. I do hold him to a lot of reverance but I tear him down over small things, the same few fights seem to get brought up. I remark on how I feel like he's inattentive, he shoots back with how my anger is out of control and I tear him down all of the time and he's right, I do. 

I don't know why these issues never get resolved. 

A few weeks ago he had the most laid back conversation with one of my best friends they were just talking about history. Neither of them did a single thing wrong but how easily they spoke about topics that interested them and the way his face lit up when he talked to her and the way they talked over me when I tried to interject just killed me. I wish he was that comfortable talking to me... 

This was weeks ago and I can't let go of it! We had several fights about it and it really isn't that I think he's going to do something with her, I trust and love them both, and he and I have had issues looooong before this instance but I just wish he spoke to me like that, with that kind of ease and confidence. 

But it's like our relationship suffers a blow every time something small like this happens. 

Every time we talk it's him asking me what's wrong and centered with all of my problems or we are outright arguing. I want to change this, I want to be normal I want to go weeks without a fight i even just want to fight about something new and different we are stuck in such an awful cycle.

I'm in a relationship with a woman that I really and truly love. There are some problems however. For instance, I'm not just from another country, but from another continent. I visited this country for work and planned to go back home after a few months, but ended up falling in love, and now I've been here for four years. I have left all of my family and friends behind, and I miss them every single day.
Our relationship is incredibly comfortable though. We know all of the other person's secrets, we trust each other with everything about our lives and our bodies, we don't have to worry about that the other person cheating. We do have bad days though, as she is bipolar and I have depression, and sometimes that leads to a lot of arguments, tears, and scars being ripped open. Sometimes she makes me feel miserable and like I should just give up, but when things are good, they are heavenly. 
What do you think I should do? Should I stay here with my love and abandon my family, or should I abandon my love to be with my family and friends?
If anyone has any advice on which is the right choice, I would be eternally grateful. It feels like I'm living my life on a fence and it's ruining me.

I know not to get too involved or attached yet until things are official.  The week before meeting him, my ex and I made plans to meet up which will be in two weeks for a weekend trip.  There is nothing complicated with my ex and I, right now it would just be a fun weekend where we would hook up and do touristy stuff.    Neither I nor him are interested in getting back together, we didn't work out and we both realize that and are okay with it but we still enjoy each other's company.   He currently lives far away which is why this is a weekend trip and we don't talk much and afterwards we wouldn't talk much then so I'm not expecting anything to become complicated with us after the trip. The trip will be a mind break full of fun.

Since I met this guy I now feel guilty about going although we are not official and I honestly have no clue about where we are headed.  Although I get the feeling he might want something more serious I have had multiple bad past experiences and no longer trust my judgement nor a guys commitment.  I realize I should not hold that against new people and I need to do what I think it right in my conscious but another part of me is saying I just met him, I don't know what will happen between us and any moment he could ghost, you never know and I don't want to say no to something when I might not even be talking to this new guy in a month.  But if it does work out it will forever make me feel guilty.

[TL;DR] I've been seeing this FWB for about 10 months now, and what had started simply sexual is rapidly feeling like it is diving into relationship territory. 

So I met this guy on a gay dating app about 10 months ago, and we hit it off on a few shared interests/fetishes. We discussed how from the beginning it's simply a sexual arrangement - he and his boyfriend are in an open relationship, and so I was simply some variety/providing services that were needed for him.

One time turned into two, two turned into four, and before I knew it we were sometimes seeing each other 2-3 times a week for our ""appointments"". 

Fast forward to April/May 2018: 

The past few weeks (we meet up every other week) have been full of dinner outings (both post hookup and just dinner varieties), multiple LONG phone calls from him a week, him staying the night (on the couch, but still staying the night and bringing a toiletry bag and clothes), more non-sexually linked kissing (not just porn style making out but more ""boyfriend"" territory kissing), and most importantly - him venting about his boyfriend, work drama, etc. Even going so far as going with me to a club, and saying after: ""I had the most fun tonight I've had in years with you""

I can provide more data for those who need it but - is it just me or is this turning into a relationship without calling it one? Do you think he's falling for me, or just bad at sending odd mixed signals?","['fwb', '33', 'm', 'fall', '26', 'm', 'hey', 'tl;dr', 'see', 'fwb', '10', 'month', 'start', 'simply', 'sexual', 'rapidly', 'feel', 'like', 'dive', 'relationship', 'territory', 'meet', 'guy', 'gay', 'dating', 'app', '10', 'month', 'ago', 'hit', 'share', 'interest', 'fetish', 'discuss', 'beginning', 'simply', 'sexual', 'arrangement', 'boyfriend', 'open', 'relationship', 'simply', 'variety', 'provide', 'service', 'need', 'time', 'turn', 'turn', 'know', 'see', '2', '3', 'time', 'week', 'appointment', 'fast', 'forward', 'april', '2018', 'past', 'week', 'meet', 'week', 'dinner', 'outing', 'post', 'hookup', 'dinner', 'variety', 'multiple', 'long', 'phone', 'call', 'week', 'stay', 'night', 'couch', 'stay', 'night', 'bring', 'toiletry', 'bag', 'clothe', 'non', 'sexually', 'link', 'kissing', 'porn', 'style', 'make', 'boyfriend', 'territory', 'kissing', 'importantly', 'vent', 'boyfriend', 'work', 'drama', 'etc', 'go', 'far', 'go', 'club', 'say', 'fun', 'tonight', 'year', 'provide', 'datum', 'need', 'turning', 'relationship', 'call', 'think', 'fall', 'bad', 'send', 'odd', 'mix', 'signal']"

We went to some military events together, but he never was forward with me in any way really. Very subtle, but I would always politely correct him.

Him and both moved on and have been talking again. He seems like he needs a lot of attention from me and wants to talk all day every day. Yes he is from the south, but I’m not. I’m from Cali, men might call you babe, but it’s typically when you’re in a relationship or he wants the booty. 
He constantly calls me honey, darlin, babe, gorgeous, sweetie,etc. I’ve never liked being called any of those names by anyone. Husband, bf, or friend. By any man or woman.
Since we started talking again, I’ve already asked him not to call me those names and he started doing it again. And I end up ignoring him because I hate it.

My boyfriend and I were together for three years. Our relationship, for the most part, was amazing and incredible. I believed I would spend the rest of my days with him. We had such great chemistry. He’s a great guy but there was a few things about him that got to me. His family is amazing as well and I believe that is one of the reasons why I stayed with him so long. I compared him to his kind family members even though he was somewhat the opposite.
Anyway, the first thing is that every so often, if I ever displayed too many emotions or was too affectionate towards him, he’d shut me down/out and say “I don’t know what I’m feeling. I don’t think I want to be in a relationship. I love and care about you but I’m not in love with you.” and ask for a break. Then a few weeks later everything is back to normal. This happened every other month for the duration of us dating. It was emotionally exhausting. Which it later down the road was influenced in my decision to break up.
When we would talk/meet again after these mini breaks, i would always drive to him. In fact in the three years that we were dating, He would never drive to me. We live about an hour apart from each other and I always drove to him because he didn’t get along with my mother. I tried to reason with him that he doesn’t have to see her because we’d be out of the house anyway. But he was insistent that I drive to him instead of the latter. 
He would also be kind of mean and careless after these breaks. For example, we went to this hibachi place a few months ago and that day I didn’t eat because I was saving my hunger for the hibachi food. Needless to say, when I got the food I ate it pretty quickly. For about 15 minutes, he kept saying “Wow, you’re like a vacuum, you swallowed that food whole.” (Side note: last year my mother and I left my abusive father so with all the stress, depression, anxiety and PTSD I gained about 20-25lbs. so I’m a tad bit insecure about my weight.) Anyway, it hurt my feelings and it seemed that anytime I ate around him, he’d say something judgmental. He would try to be funny at my expense in front of his two older siblings as well.
Next thing is the way he would guilt trip me into having any sexual relations. My mother and I have been living under hard times and we moved three different times in the past 6 months. In result, my depression has gone downhill. To the point where I became suicidal. But no matter what, my then-boyfriend would intentionally make me feel worse because I’m not pleasuring him. It got to the point where he would bring it up multiple times a day. I felt terrible for being stuck with depression and felt even worse because I couldn’t give him any sexual satisfaction. 
Still, I tried explaining to him that my mental health isn’t up to par and he seemed to not understand fully and brought up the topic of sex. With the stress from my abusive father, stress of where I might live next month, stress that my boyfriend couldn’t be there for me, I began to bottle up my emotions and became distant. Him asking for breaks so many times really made an impact on me. I felt that I had to keep my guard up so when he did ask for yet another break, I would be prepared and not get hurt again. He noticed almost immediately and was apologizing for the way he treated me and he said essentially sex would resolve the issue. I boiled over and broke up with him. I told him that I needed to focus on my mental health because I felt myself slipping with reality. But I continued to reassure him that I’ll always be in love with him and that I’ll still keep in contact. I slowly stopped talking to Jonas often because my life got busy and before I knew it, a month goes by. I texted him and he was noticeably short with me as if I was bothering him and it was an inconvenience to talk to me. I didn’t think to much of it but after the conversations ended, I started to overthink. That I would lose him as a friend. I began to feel immense guilt because I broke up with him. I kept rationalizing that I had to because my mental health was deteriorating. I caved and messaged him two weeks later and he was even shorter than before. My messages was basically me saying that he feels resentment towards me and doesn’t want me in his life, I’d understand. He said not to worry and that it was a good idea and he still wants to be friends. I felt somewhat of a relief and then I asked that once I got my mental health in check, would he like to go to grab a bite to eat. He said it wasn’t a good idea and after asking he confessed that he is seeing someone else. The news took my by surprise and it was like a punch to the gut. I told him I hoped for the best and all I want is him to be happy and left it at that. 
It was clear that he didn’t want to be friends. That conversation took place this past Friday. I kept replaying the conversation in my head to the point that I feel more guilt because I decided to focus more on my mental health than my boyfriend. Anytime he asked for a break because of his issues, I’d still be there for him. He’s moved on so fast and i should have never expected him to wait for me even though I’d did that for him. But now I feel this unbelievable weight of misery and helplessness. I feel like I should regret that I made the decision to break up with him and just sucked it up. Am I wrong? I’ve been feel a lump in my chest since Friday morning because of that conversation.

TLDR: Boyfriend of three years always made me feel unloved and unworthy by all the breaks that he asks to have because of his issues along with other factors. My mental health started to spiral downward and I broke up with him before it made things too complicated. Month and a half passed and he’s already seeing someone. Feel guilty and I’m beginning to think that I should have kept quiet to avoid losing him at the expense of my mental health.

Somebody sent them a picture of her.,"Hey, just wanted to get something off my chest and ask for some advice. Maybe some of you have had a similar experience. The other day at work (in Japan) my girlfriend (Japanese) got called by an ""entertainment"" scout who said that a ""reader"" had chosen her and sent a picture of her to the company. They knew her full name too (she wears a name tag). They invited her to some kind of contest in the fall. She told them she couldn't go and hung up. Afterwards she researched the company and found out it was an AV company. They said they were located in Tokyo or something.

If any of you have had experience with this, I'd like to ask a few questions.
1. How persistent are these scouts? Do they give up after one rejection, or will they call again?
2. Will anyone from the company try to meet her in person?
3. What about the ""reader"" who took a picture of her? Is that just bullshit? Another scout? Or is there a potential stalker we might be dealing with?
4. If there is a stalker, or just a pervert, what's the best course of action? Of course I would love to catch the bastard and have a talk with him, but I don't know how possible that is (and the laws on assault here).

We got talking and she told me about her boyfriend and actually being in the same situation as me. She told me lots more and really opened up to me and vice versa, we had talked for the entire night. We both went home at around 4am and since she lives close by she left at the same time as me. Once near my house we stopped to talk a little more and I think we stood there for over an hour. At home we followed eachother on insta and started talking even more. Basically, we clicked really really well.

I sort of like her older sister, and I think the sister may like me back - what should I do, if anything?","To fill you in on the backstory, I've never been in a relationship. Met this one super cool girl and became extremely interested. Well, I was a wuss and let my worry of being rejected prevent me from ever even becoming good friends with her. We know each other and talk from time to time but nothing special at this point, my fault and it's really my first big regret in life.

Well anyway, a few months ago I started seeing her hanging around with this other guy quite a bit, and my fears were confirmed shortly thereafter. So the girl of my dreams is off the table, at least for now.

Her older sister is really cool as well, and I think I may like her too, but obviously I'm not yet sure. I also think she may like me as well, as she seems to pay more attention to me than other guys   and has given me quite a few hugs and made multiple comments that seem to denote interest, but maybe I'm just grasping at straws. :)

Anyway, the older sister is single. I'm feeling sort of lonely, as I'm a pretty anti-social person. I've got a few close male friends, but talking to girls is *super* hard for me, for really no reason. 

I guess what I'm trying to get at is, should I explore the possibility of being with the older sister just to see what happens, or would that destroy the possibility of ever having a chance with the younger one?

He's 21 and has never been kissed, let alone been on a date. I think he's a little awkward and doesn't always get social cues, but deep down he's very sweet. We've been hanging out for about 2/3 months. He's taken me on three dates - once to the movies and twice to the local pub (I'm an American exchange student in England).

We've cuddled in his room before watching movies, but that's as far as it's gone. He knows I've had boyfriends before, but the secret is that I'm also a virgin (technical one, I've fooled around before). The thing is, I always got sexual once I was dating, never a FWB or one-night-stand thing. I'm really extroverted on the outside, but pretty conservative when it comes to my sex life (I only want to have sex in a monogamous relationship. that just works for me).

Two nights ago we were at his place and got REALLY drunk. He had so many drinks I lost count, I finished off an entire bottle of wine and we both shared a bottle of gin. One thing led to another, and he kissed me.

I thought it was really sweet. I know he was really nervous, and I haven't kissed a guy in a while. But then we kept going further and further. Inside I really wasn't sure if I wanted to, but he seemed so excited to finally reach this point.

The night ended with both of us naked. He said multiple times he'd stop if I wanted to, but I could tell he kept wanting to go on and at one point when I was hesitant said he really wanted me to take off my bra because we already made it this far, but then again said I could stop if I really wanted to.

To put it in vague terms, we did ""hand stuff."" Nothing I haven't done before, but NEVER that quickly. In the morning when he was sleeping I snuck out, and we haven't seen each other since (though we've texted a little bit about school).

I don't see us actually having a relationship. I'm moving back to the US in three weeks. But I do want to see him again, I just don't want to go that far, if that makes sense. It already JUST hit the furthest I'm comfortable with.

How do I tell him that without it being weird? Can I even ask him to take it slower? I don't want him to feel like he took advantage of me, I've made out with guys who were real assholes when I said I wanted to stop. We were both drunk, I just want to take it slower than that in the future.

I just need advice. I feel like such a prude but I want to keep spending time with him.

**tl;dr:** Fooled around with a guy, it went further than I'm comfortable with because we were both wasted. When I see him again I want to ask if we can take it slower, but don't want it to come off weird.","['21', 'f', 'go', 'far', 'sexually', 'sure', 'tell', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'guy', 'definitely', 'introverted', 'person', 'meet', '21', 'kiss', 'let', 'date', 'think', 'little', 'awkward', 'social', 'cue', 'deep', 'sweet', 'hang', '2/3', 'month', 'take', 'date', 'movie', 'twice', 'local', 'pub', 'american', 'exchange', 'student', 'england', 'cuddle', 'room', 'watch', 'movie', 'far', 'go', 'know', 'boyfriend', 'secret', 'virgin', 'technical', 'fool', 'thing', 'get', 'sexual', 'date', 'fwb', 'night', 'stand', 'thing', 'extroverte', 'outside', 'pretty', 'conservative', 'come', 'sex', 'life', 'want', 'sex', 'monogamous', 'relationship', 'work', 'night', 'ago', 'place', 'get', 'drunk', 'drink', 'lose', 'count', 'finish', 'entire', 'bottle', 'wine', 'share', 'bottle', 'gin', 'thing', 'lead', 'kiss', 'think', 'sweet', 'know', 'nervous', 'kiss', 'guy', 'keep', 'go', 'inside', 'sure', 'want', 'excited', 'finally', 'reach', 'point', 'night', 'end', 'naked', 'say', 'multiple', 'time', 'stop', 'want', 'tell', 'keep', 'want', 'point', 'hesitant', 'say', 'want', 'bra', 'far', 'say', 'stop', 'want', 'vague', 'term', 'hand', 'stuff', 'quickly', 'morning', 'sleep', 'sneak', 'see', 'texte', 'little', 'bit', 'school', 'actually', 'have', 'relationship', 'move', 'week', 'want', 'want', 'far', 'make', 'sense', 'hit', 'furthest', 'comfortable', 'tell', 'weird', 'ask', 'slow', 'want', 'feel', 'like', 'take', 'advantage', 'guy', 'real', 'asshole', 'say', 'want', 'stop', 'drunk', 'want', 'slow', 'future', 'need', 'advice', 'feel', 'like', 'prude', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'tl;dr', 'fool', 'guy', 'go', 'comfortable', 'waste', 'want', 'ask', 'slow', 'want', 'come', 'weird']"

I think it's really shitty to tell a person that has expressed their feelings towards you what she told me, but perhaps I am being dramatic. I'm not sure exactly why it makes me feel so terrible. I just think she is looking for attention, or is completely oblivious and selfish when it comes to others' emotions. I'm not sure which. I just feel really sad about the whole ordeal - not jealous, but it makes me feel small, and sad that one of my close friends has such disregard for both my and her other friend's feelings towards her.

This has happened like six different times.

I also noticed she took a picture in his kitchen in a hat saying ""I like my new hat,"" so obviously it's a recent picture. I understand they have a child together and supposedly haven't been together for years. Who goes to their ex's house and takes a selfie if they already have a boyfriend?

That same night she posted that selfie at his place he said he loved me for the first time. Was he looking for validation with me because maybe she turned him down? We also had more intimate conversations but now they're more friendly and it makes feel confused.

What do you guys think? Am I paranoid or are my concerns legitimate?

After talking to a close friend, she thought that he was ready to tell me that he loved me or something like that. On the 15th, it'll be 4 months together and I believe that I'm starting to fall in love with him, not in love yet but in the early beginning stages of it.

Anyways, this morning I finally got the courage to tell him when we woke up. I asked him last night what he meant by what he said the other night but his response was ""I was just joking around"" and ""We've already talked about this"" so I shrugged it off and we went to bed. But when I woke up this morning, I just made myself tell him and before I could even get out my whole sentence, he said ""I know"". Mind you, all I got out was ""I think I'm..."" before he interrupted me and said that.

He said ""Don't you think its too early?"" and ""It's too premature in our relationship for this as I just moved back home 2 weeks ago and we have 3 months left before I move back for school so things can still happen"" (we're currently in an LDR). After I told him that I'm not in love with him but in the beginning stages, he told me that he kinda feels the same way but still feels like its too premature in the relationship.

The way he said these things kind of upset me but I get where he's coming from. I'm just anxious now that I may have scared him off or whatever. We spent all day together today but he left around 30 minutes ago and we still have plans for next weekend but now I'm just a big ball of anxiousness (I have undiagnosed anxiety).

I have been dating my girlfriend for the past two years. To be honest, she isn't a mean person. But, I have made her upset in the past and she can get mean.

Last night, we went to a party with some friends and she made a comment about the meat we were eating. She said that she didn't like the taste of meat anymore and jokingly said that she'll be eating soy burgers with my family \(my family is forced to be vegetarian because my mom became vegetarian\). The joke alone was a bit embarrassing to me because she knows why we're vegetarian and she hates soy in general. I just wanted to be alone after that because of how humiliating the joke was. There wasn't any place for me go away to. My girlfriend tried to apologize and I told her to not worry about it.

After seeing that I was upset about the joke, she started acting hostile towards me. She kept telling me that I should be having fun with our friends. It got me frustrated, so I went to a more secluded place from the crowd. She came over and yelled at me. She was questioning me why I stick with her if I'm going to be so miserable around her. We later talked about what had happened and I told her that she was being abusive. She said that she promises to change, but I feel so frustrated and sad.

We once had a communication issue. She was very quiet, shut\-in, and hard to engage in a conversation. I had told her before, but she was not improving as she had promised. Recently, I had made a friend \(19/f\) and was fun to talk to. We just bonded so well together that she became my best friend. I had made a comment about her to my girlfriend saying that my friend was easy to talk to. My girlfriend then asked, ""Is she easier to talk to than me?"" I didn't want to lie or avoid the question, so I answered ""Yes."" She knew that we had been talking for a while, so my girlfriend tried to control me; she said that she didn't want me to talk or text my friend. I did the right thing and stood up to her. I later reassured her that I didn't have feelings for my friend.

Our friends had planned to eat together at a restaurant together after that incident. My friend and I had different class schedules, so we were not going to be able to go to the assigned date. I jokingly said that we should watch a movie together and she later carried on that joke by agreeing to it \(at the time, I didn't know it was a joke\). So I asked my girlfriend if it was okay with her if my friend and I watched a movie. My girlfriend believed that it was a date, despite me reassuring her that it wasn't. I later found out that my friend was confronted by my girlfriend. It devastated my friend that my girlfriend was acting hostile towards her. 

About a week later, my girlfriend and I talk about what had happened. I admitted to fault for not telling her that she was lacking communication skills again. Since then, she has improved on it.

This concerns me because I had questioned her about meeting another woman like my friend. I had even thought to myself, ""What if a woman does end up being attracted to me? How will my girlfriend handle that?"" The last thing that I want is for my girlfriend to end up hurting someone else.

These are only a few cases that she has been abusive. This concerns me because we have talked about moving in together in two months. I don't want to be stuck in a relationship where I'm unhappy or living with someone abusive.

I have put a lot of thought into this matter, but I don't think I'm going anywhere with this.

Jealousy or something else?","This is a long one, but I would love some advice on this platonic friendship situation (I'm gay, no romance in this one). I recently took a trip with two friends, one that I have known well for 2+ years (26/F) and another that I have only known for about half that time (24/F). I met 24/f through 26/f due to the fact that we were all going to be vacationing together for an extended period, and 26/f wanted to make the vacation as smooth as possible so she introduced us a few months before we all traveled together. We hung out as a group a few times and I felt that we all got along swimmingly and felt comfortable going into the trip and expected to have nice getaway. 

Jump forward to the trip and it turns into a drama filled mess, with 26/f being visibly irritated for several days straight during every group conversation - there were other people with us that can attest to 26/f being really pissy for most of the time, especially toward 24/f. Leading up to the point of 26/f's visible irritation, I was being chatty with everyone, trying to get to know new people in the group, etc., like people do while traveling together but it was bugging me that she seemed so irritated and mad and to be honest assumed it was something I had done. 

So toward the end of the trip I decided to ask 26/f what the drama is about and she tells me that she cannot stand how fake 24/f is being with me and that she has never seen her act this way with anyone in all the years she's known her. I'm totally shocked at this reveal because until this point, I had assumed 24/f was being genuine with me and that we had I a essentially created a good bond with a new friend, which is my favorite part of travel. 

So I'm like whoa, ok and I decide to back off of talking with 24/f because she's a new friend at this point and I'd known 26/f for a long time. 26/f remains annoyed the entirety of the trip and we return home and a few weeks pass. I speak with 26/f daily so I occasionally check in on her relationship with 24/f and am reminded that they aren't communicating at all, but that 26/f has plans to talk to her about what happened on the trip. 25/f tells me that she will never hang out with 24/f and I at the same time again, feels harsh, but ok...OH and I've been reminded repeatedly that I did nothing wrong by 26/f - we still talk and hang very regularly. 

Three months pass (brining us to present day) and I have had no communication with 24/f, but 26/f and her have made up, and friends from the trip still ramble about how fake 24/f was with me on the trip, while I look on and say ok whatever. 26/f and 24/f hang out but I am never invited and hear about it later from other mutual friends.  

I have to be honest, the whole scenario left me with a bad taste in my mouth - I essentially gave up a connection because I had known one person longer than the other, but in the end get short-changed because 26/f hangs with 24/f but doesn't invite me and I'm fairly sure that if 26/f would feel betrayed if I hang with 24/f. 

I would love some thoughts on this - it's been bugging me for a couple weeks straight recently and I still wonder why someone would get that annoyed over friends becoming friends with friends - I've always been a ""the more, the merrier"" type of person. And should I still try to create a friendship with 24/f? - it's been three months since we've talked at this point. Thanks!

After 2 years, she started texting a guy co worker, and started lying about hanging out with her friends when it was with this other guy.  I eventually found out she had been fucking him and and confronted her about it, the thing that was most shocking is she seemed to not feel that bad about it.  As fucked up as things were, we end up taking a trip with me (that we had booked awhile back).  Things got better, but she was still texting that guy and I everytime I tell her how fucked up it is, she gets defensive or doesnt want to talk about it.  She keeps hanging with me and we have sex alot still.  That makes me feel like she doesn't really value that other guy either if shes still having sex with me.  Deep down, I know the answer is to leave her ass and move on.

790,8j7elm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j7elm/stay_or_leave_my_confrontational_partner/,Stay or leave my confrontational partner,"My partner is very confrontational. He can get set off by many things, but if he's just complaining about something into blue air or as part of a discussion I don't mind, it can even be interesting. But when he confronts people performing whatever service for the smallest infraction it gets annoying and even embarrassing. I'm doubting if I should stay.  

He's black and sees racism and discrimination everywhere, but even if he's right about it, he confronts the wrong person like the public worker who is simply following the local law by adressing him in the local language rather than English. I know the law and I know these people often don't have a choice. 

Today on a Sunday he found the time to confront 3 people: one police woman who asked him why he hadn't learnt the local language after living here for 6 years (she can legally only provide the service he needed in the local language. It's not a great law imho, but it's not her who made the law). He did have a pretty funny response though,  asking her why the colonisers didn't learn the African languages after living there for centuries.. gotta give him ptops for that comeback. Then at noon he confronted a service clerk at the trainstation thinking he intentionally couldn't  find his data in their system because of racism. In the evening he confronted the waiter at a restaurant calling the place a rip off and wanting to cancel our food order (too late) over the prices of the drinks which were clearly displayed to us before ordering so he had had all opportunity to see the prices before ordering. The rest of the meal he kept complaining about everything, refusing to eat much of the food and called them thief's in several languages they could understand. When we got the bill he loudly  proclaimed that he was gonna check it because he knew people like this would try to cheat us. He was actually right they had charged us one drink too many. This resulted in him yelling at the waiter and even saying a rude comment about the waiters weight  when he was still within earshot. I felt humiliated and mortified. I believe you catch more flies with honey. He's clearly more of a vinegar fan. He likes his style, thinks it's a virtue to confront people when what they are doing is 'not right' yet is usually not happy and very defensive when I confront him with what I find 'not right' about his approach. 

If I was in my 20ies I wouldn't stick around. But I'm 35 and I want kids.. can't keep searching for prince charming because of stupid ovaries, but  should I settle for Mr rude and offensive?

My own dad was abusive and I don't want to repeat that cycle. Mostly my bf is very sweet with kids though. I am afraid what he'd pass on to our kids. I'm also a big cuddler, he doesn't like affection, doesnt have much empathy, and we have very dissimilar tastes. Plus sides: He's a straight shooter, will not tell you nice things just to make you happy so when he says something he means it. He is faithful in as far as I know and very intelligent and responsible. Doesn't run away from the relationship whenever there's a problem. Maybe coz he loves confrontations so much.

Something significant, I suppose, is that I have gone from being a homebody to really liking being out of my residence for long periods of time.

I do have depression, and being inside definitely tends to stir up those feelings. 

My boyfriend prefers staying inside. We go out sometimes, but I know he gets antsy and is eager to go back home after a bit. Otherwise, I do go out on my own and do things if I really want to do them. I appreciate his efforts on my behalf, and I would like to be able to do the same. 

I just have a difficult time finding fun things to do with him while staying home. He plays video games, and I do too sometimes, but not nearly as much as I used to. We do that sometimes, but I can't do it long. We also sometimes watch TV shows we like or movies, but again, I can't do that a lot. 

So far, we mostly just play video games or watch TV. I'd love some more options for us that are not either of those or sex.

They all think it’s weird that I’ve never had a boyfriend or anything. I’m a very socially awkward and introverted person so I’m not very outgoing and the only time I feel comfortable is around my friends. I am Demi sexual which means that I only find people attractive if I like their personality or have a deep emotional bond with them, but nobody seems to get that. My best friend (let’s call her Betty) has had 2 boyfriends and always asks out every boy she basically ever meets (a bit of an over reaction but you get what I mean) . 

Betty has told me that her previous boyfriend (let’s call him John) showed her his penis and tried to touch her boob on continuous occasions. Today, I was round at Betty’s house and she told me and a group of my other friends, whilst we were all sitting In the living room, that her and John kissed so passionately that they fell onto the floor in this room. We all dared her to reenact it, so she did. The only thing is Betty is a compulsive liar and I have no idea if she’s telling the truth. Also, Betty pressures me whenever I’m round her house or at school with friends to either play spin the bottle or truth or dare. Most of the dares involve kissing. I feel like I’m being pressured to have my first kiss and if I don’t pick a dare or do it I am called a “kill joy” it’s really starting to annoy me that she doesn’t understand my sexuality. My other friends seem to get it (kind of).  

I feel like I should’ve had my first kiss by now. Even people at school think it’s weird. For example, the other day, we were talking about going to Betty’s house and a boy over heard us talking about spin the bottle and I said “I don’t want my first kiss to be in a game” and he instantly goes “You haven’t had your first kiss yet?!” I shook my head and he said “really? Woah” I’m sick of being pressured and I feel like if I don’t have my first kiss soon then everyone will make me feel worse about it. 

Tl;dr my friends keep pressuring me to have my first kiss and find it weird that it hasn’t happened yet. They keep trying to make me play games which involve kissing and I feel weird that it hasn’t happened yet. Advice?

797,8j73h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j73h5/was_i_cheated_on_does_she_love_me/,Was I cheated on? Does she love me?,"Sorry for the long lost. Can’t really TLDR this. 

I started seeing this girl in March. Took her out for a few lunches and dinners, not as dates but genuinely just to get to know her. I insisted to pay just because that’s who I am. I started really liking to hang out with her. 

One night I’m in her room, it’s getting late and we’re sitting on her bed. I am an affectionate person, and I had a small crush on her at this point so I get cuddly. She kisses me. We kiss till 4 AM. She gave me the loveliest nose kisses ever. 
The next morning she texts me saying she just wants to be friends etc... I’m disappointed but fine with it. As I said, she’s a lovely person. I love hanging out with her and she’s weird in the good way and into the same sports that I am. Over the next two weeks we get closer after going to work out together and eating together. One night I’m high, and decide to go to her room (bad decision I know), while there I ask her to kiss me. This is how I remember it: she’s hesitant at first but then kisses me, I walk in and for the rest of the night we’re talking on her bed and kissing just like last time. However when she told me what happened she said I was very insistant and pushy. To be honest I wouldn’t be surprised if I was. I was told that I’m pushy before. I felt horrible. I apologized profusely but she said it was fine. The next morning she also texted me saying she still just wants to be friends and that’s she sorry she’s confused because she’s not entirely over her ex. Fast forward a month where I see her almost every day, she accepts my hugs and loves them (we have each other really long hugs, like 20 minutes it was wonderful every time. We’d talk while hugging lol).


At this point I should mention a few things. We are in the same dorm. It’s finals season so I was seeing her less. A guy called M has taken her to see a movie but she said he was uninteresting beforehand so I wasn’t jealous. I was leaving for the summer (4 months) in a few days.

We are now Friday of my last week there. Earlier in the week I went to see the sunset with my roommate, she said we should do the same, I was delighted. On this day we bike to the lake and watch the sunset. I really really wanted to kiss her but I hold back. As soon as the sun sets she immediately gets up and tells me she wants to leave to go to a party. I was offended as I was leaving soon and thought we’d be spending the night together talking. I saw alright and she leaves. Later in the night at about 1AM she texts me asking if I’m awake. I say sure and she comes to my room slightly tipsy. She gets comfortable on my bed so I ask my roomate to leave. This part is a tiny bit fuzzy but Either she tried to kiss me or said she wanted too. In either case I told her I wouldn’t be kissing her because she was tipsy and also because I felt so sad every morning getting rejecting texts from her. She says she’s really not that tipsy (she sobered up) and she promised me she wouldn’t send me a text. She mentioned that she left the sunset abruptly because she felt like she wanted to kiss me. We kiss. We talked. We cuddled, danced, kissed, I fondled her breasts and kissed them with her careful consent (she told me she did indeed consent the next day) and then she cried in my arms because I was leaving. I felt love for her. After I consoled her and we were lying together I told her so. She said she had something to say before leaving but my roomate barged in pissed because it was 4AM. She leaves. 


In the next few days every time I see her I kiss her, sometimes asking if I can and waiting for an answer and sometimes not. She gives me a card to read on my birthday. On the last day we go for a walk in the park together where she let me hold her hand and I kissed her goodbye. 


I’m in another country. We haven’t really talked yet. It’s my birthday, one week later. I’m so excited and read the lovely letter she wrote me. At the end she wrote “PS I love you” in my mother tongue. I was so happy. It was hard to read as something just a friend would write. 

To note: earlier in the week we texted shortly talking about us and she said she was confused etc... and that I should read the letter as a friend. I told her that if it helped she could forget everything romantic between us so it wouldn’t confuse her and we’d pick up in September. I thought she was still confused about her Exs because she talked about two of them a lot so I thought well maybe a part of her loves me but also loves them. She texts me that she loves me so much, but here I believe in the friend context because I told her I can still love friends. 


The day after my birthday she still hasn’t called me and I ask when she wants too. She says in about a week. After some chit chat about that being too long and her being confused she says: “Well what if I told you I was dating M, isn’t that confusing?” My heart broke. I tore and threw the letter away. I was mad. I told her I’d tell M she basically cheated on him if she didn’t answer my texts (she wasn’t answering) and that I wanted an explanation. She said I was rude for threatening her and that I was a self absorbed asshole. She said I should be happy for her like her friends are. We talked and I defused the situation telling her I felt so sad and trying to understand. She said that when I left: “You kissed me” which I thought was bullshit. She said that she didn’t just cry for me but for all her friends who were leaving. (Fair enough). I am heartbroken. We never formalized a commitment because I was leaving but I felt cheated on. I expected to come back to a girlfriend. She told me that after going home and digesting berthing that happened that term that she realized she didn’t want to date me. (That hurt so much). After a day I told her that I was happy for her and that we’d be friends when I came back (I don’t know if I was lying or not but I’m not entirely sure I want her out of my life, I still love her). She said she appreciates it. Now we’re not really talking I guess because I need to move on?


Did she cheat on me? What should I be feeling? How do I make sense of this? Yeah 

Edit: Some more details. We’re both 18. She told her parents about me. I got her flowers once because I hurt her back by accident, she loved them. Personally I think that she’s co fused about who she loves because pat down point during our fight she even said that she doesn’t love M she likes him. That confused me. I honk part of her loves her Ex’s and me and M and she’s just lost and doesn’t want to be lonely for the summer. I suggested his idea to her telling her I’d understand if this was the case because I don’t want to be lonely either and I understand. She didn’t say anything. She’s seeing a therapist for other issues starting this week.

I don't know what to do help!,"Okay so I was just at a local gaming cafe and this guy walks in. I noticed that he's a rapper who I'm a huge fan of. I walk up and start talking to him, we start flirting and he gives his number. The next day he calls and we set up a date for Saturday night. 

Saturday night I head to the bar. I see a purple car pull up. He sticks his head out the window and gestures for me to come in. I'm sitting there in the car not sure what to do and we start driving away from the bar. He tells me the bar is bought out for a party so we're going on a ""double date"" with his friends.

I cringe cause this wasn't really what I was expecting and was a little pissed he changed plans so quick but I go along with it. We go to his condo and one of his guards is there with another girl. We start talking and drinking, but the other girl starts arguing with her date and they storm out, apparently he found texts from another guy or something? 

Now this is where it gets weird. The flirting gets more intense so I start flirting back, stroking his arm etc. We start out kissing, but then he flips out Snapchat as it heats up. I'm thinking *oh, shit...*. This rapper posts a lot of pics with girls but the ones in his pics are from a modeling agency so I assumed he wasn't really having sex with them. I duck out of the camera and now I'm in the bathroom...

I'm afraid I'll just be another one of the girls he brags about on some song. We texted a lot beforehand and he seemed really into me. Someone help?

800,8j6wfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j6wfm/my_24f_friend_30sm_belittles_me_in_front_of_our/,"My [24F] ""friend"" [30sM] belittles me in front of our friend group.","My friends [22F, 20F, 20M] met through the D&D club at college, Susan [20F] introduced us to another guy Tim [35?M] that she'd dated a few years back, we formed a little group of friends. I didn't like Tim from the get-go, one of the first things he said to me was ""You're just like me, but less funny"" as our personalities are very similar. From there our fights got constantly worse until after a year and a half it was so bad that I took a couple months away from the group just to clear my head.

I talked to my best friend Anne [22F] who Tim was becoming best friends with too, he was now spending nearly no time with Susan, and she made things amicable for a while upon my return. 6~ months later the amicability is wearing off. There have been little snipes, like making a point of stopping the game to ask me in front of everyone why I'm texting at the table when I was on call for work, which he knew, and is something I'd never done before in the years we've been playing together. He just blew me off and went back to the game without apologising.

I'm artistic, I draw a lot, so I drew some fanart of our gaming group and posted it to our facebook. His only comment on it was ""I'm gonna post it to reddit to see how many likes I can get"". I did not consent to this and when I stated I was uncomfortable and removed my art from the group he blew up on me about how selfish I am and how I never do anything for the group or him, and how bad of a player/ friend I am. This was in public and no one bothered to defend me, all of which has happened before. I'm the only person that ever bothers to organise when we play, since we all have different schedules and there's maybe one day a week we can all get together, which changes every week. He runs the game but I do all of the organising.

My breaking point was recently, he broke a day long silence in our group chat to passive aggressively call me stubborn for no reason- no one had mentioned him or spoken to him in the chat in that time- then segued his statement about me into a rape joke which are so common now I don't even notice them. When I called him out on it he acted like I was picking on him. Anne laughed when he belittled me, and then when I defended myself she asked if ""we could all stop fighting"". Later on I asked her what I should do about the situation, as she knows us both well, but she never offers help or advice, instead I get ""It's your life, do what makes you happy/ you do you/ you should decide for yourself"". She even offered to listen to me vent about the situation, then a line of venting in said ""I don't want to talk about it."" Other than when I need help Anne is like a typical best friend and we get on great, but the lack of emotional support is really hurting me.

Tim has ""anger issues"" that he mentions daily, along with depression and ADHD, which cause him to snap often but only ever at me, whether he snaps at Anne or Su in private I don't know but they never mention it. We all have depression and/ or anxiety, and only Mark [20M] is diagnosed with being on the spectrum but I think the rest of us are too, none of us are in great mental health but Tim is the only one that mentions it near constantly and uses his mental health as an excuse for things. I don't know if I'm being gaslighted because every time he snaps at me he transitions into playing the victim really quickly and no one in the group ever admit that he may have been wrong. None of my friends have ever or do ever defend me when he snaps, and they're all really reluctant to provide any help to me when I ask for it after the fact. Anne only ever defends him from me when we talk in private, and will never even admit something small like ""what he said was wrong"" or anything. She says she defends me when he rants to her in private too, but I don't know how much I believe it.

The last time I left the group everyone expressed to me how much it upset them, except Tim, but now I'm thinking about leaving again. I don't know if I'm making the right decision. He's never apologised, in fact I've apologised to him a few times for losing my temper in our fights. I explain how I feel to Su/ Anne or ask for help I get the same non-answers. I have to ask other friends that don't know our group, or people on reddit, because all of the people involved have no inclination to help me. Everyone outside the group says it sounds terrible, but inside the group no one will say anything but platitudes and nothing answers. We're playing together in a couple of hours and I dunno if I should just say I can't make it, or drop out fully, it's one of the most fun things in my life but I'm growing to hate Tim again more and more.

I’ve always had issues socializing, I don’t have many friends.  In eighth grade, I made friends with this girl, we’ve always been close and I’ve loved her platonically since then.  She moved away, we kept in touch for a couple years, then she visited our mutual friend last summer and we spent a lot of time together.  She had mild feelings for me then.  

At the end of that summer, we both moved, and it was really rough on us both.  We both basically turned to each other and talked about what we were going through, supported each other, etc.  I made plans to visit her and some other friends this next summer and she asked if I was open to the idea of having sex with her then.  I said yes, we both trusted each other a lot and we’ve always had a strong bond.  We talked for a few more months, and both started to slowly develop feelings.  

Eventually, we talked like we were basically in a relationship and I asked her to be my girlfriend.  We FaceTime every night now.  I feel a genuine, stable bond with her, we have a very healthy relationship and we communicate, and I’ll be seeing her soon.

My friend and I E, have known each other since freshman year of high school. And I've had unrequited love for her for about 4 years. 

We've been spending a lot of time together recently and Friday night we kissed. It was a natural thing, like it just happened, if you catch my drift. Then we talked about our feelings and what we want from each other, and it seems we're on the same page, which is great. 

Now, I have struggled with anxiety my whole life. I get stuck in my head and blow things out of proportion. Now that this good thing came to me, of course I have plenty of worries, which primarily extend from my self esteem and feelings of inadequacy. 

Some of these anxieties include:
Being too needy,
Being to distant as to not seem to needy,
Pushing feelings too fast,
Her leaving my life completely, etc.

We're not officially together but we both said we want a relationship. I value our friendship and don't want to lose that, but a relationship could be even more fulfilling for us both. 

I know I need to talk to her about these feelings, so I guess what I'm asking is; how do I bring them up appropriately and what is an actual concern and not just irrational anxiety?

I still have the ability to visit the cat whenever I wanted and we agreed to remain friends. 

As of today, I haven't spoken to him in over a week, but I find that I always start to think of him, and then I start peeking at his Facebook to see if he's active and to see if he blocked me. I told him I wouldn't block him, so that is not an option for me. I don't think about our cat as much as I thought I was. I'm not sure why. 

I cut myself off from talking to him because he was always the first person that I would talk to. The last couple of conversations that we had involved us laughing like we were friends and talking about some of the serious stuff like we were friends. But I still have feelings that I wouldn't show him. I took the time to heal myself and told him that I would reach out again when I'm ready. I also wonder what he might be thinking. I say that can do whatever he wants now, but I really am hurt at the idea he might be trying to find another relationship. 

Does this mean that it's him I miss? Does this mean that I really was in love with him?

M is does not reciprocate feelings,"Let’s start with this. I’m not a very attractive person whatsoever. It’s a lot harder for me to get dates since people don’t look past the physical appearance, but one time: someone did. 

This person, we will call C. C was perfect for me, we had been friends for awhile but I hated him in the past. I haven’t experienced much when it comes to love so I’m very unexperienced in this matter. Anyways, I had a “crush” on C for a little bit, and eventually he asked me out. It has been more than one year since that and we are still dating. 

I still love him, I really do. But the only problem is; he does not reciprocate feelings as much as I do, and he has a vocabulary of about 5 words. the first 3 months were strong with us, with constant reciprocation, etc. But, I’m his longest lasting relationship, and he’s mine, but he doesn’t try whatsoever. I buy him a lot, take him to concerts, show feeling and make sure to tell him I love him constantly, and overall I really do care for him. 

I’ve never really had thought about it until I started to get a little bored, because I never get to actually have a conversation with him. It’s been more than one year and the farthest we’ve gotten is a hug. It just makes me feel like I’m unwanted. I’m young so sex was never in mind, as I’d like to wait until I’m quite older. But I just wish I felt a lot more wanted in the relationship. 

I’m really trying my best to keep him happy, but even my family is starting to tell me that things are happening. I always blamed it on my anxiety, that I was being too over dramatic since I am prone to do such, but am I? I’m trying so hard to keep it together and I’m trying so hard to get him to show some feeling, but I just can’t. He says he loves me, sure, but I just want him to show it rather than making me do all the work to show? 

I don’t wanna break up with him because I’m not entirely unhappy, I do love him, but I just want him to show more feeling towards me because he just seems.. void of such. I really want our relationship to be strong and happy because I really care for him.. but it really seems like he’s unhappy and I want to be the best I can be, but I’m reaching the point where I can’t do much more. I’ve tried to be patient but I’m reaching my peak and I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

So now that I’ve explained it to the best extent that I can— what should I do? I wanna talk to him but my anxiety is so bad to the point where I just don’t wanna ruin what I still have. I really want to continue the relationship but I feel like I’m holding onto broken pieces and I really want to try to repair what we had, but I’m not sure how to. I might just be being overdramatic but I just wanna figure out if my anxiety is just being stupid.

We only told few close friends and our immediate family. I know for sure that MIL told some of their relatives because DH (35/M) told me then but they all knew that it hurt me so much and chose not to talk about it so I did not get not even 1 sorry for you loss from that side which was fine with me.

Then today, I get a happy Mother’s Day card/ greeting in my Facebook inbox from one of DH's aunts. I broke down and all the pain came back. I knew that this was supposedly my first Mother’s Day but I have been trying so hard to keep my mind off it. I cried (still crying) and i feel so mad that DH's aunt is that insensitive. DH was able to tell that I am in pain and upset at the same time but he immediately got too defensive and told me not to judge so quickly as aunt is 50+ years old and not Facebook savvy. This made everything worse.  Instead of him apologizing for what his aunt did, DH is making me feel that its my fault and im just being overly too sensitive.  Please note that I checked the message multiple times and it was not a massive or spam message. It was only sent to ME, not a group of females.  

My mom is in another state so unfortunately I will be spending today with them. Am I overreacting for thinking that the aunt is so insensitive and that MIL definitely told the entire family when we asked her not to?  How do I keep it cool with DH's family today and for the rest of my life knowing that first, they don't respect our  privacy and second, it clearly looks like they are too insensitive and need to go back to preschool to learn some manners.

I have 2 classes with her in a total of 8 (4 classes per day). We have the same group of friends and we’re alright friends (not too familiar with each other but we tell jokes and mess around). So the problems are that I have a pretty big crush on her although she’s an exchange student and leaves later in summer, but I really want to ask her out and see where it goes. I don’t really have any idea if she likes me or not, (I’m pretty sure I’m the only person she takes jokingly makes fun of and laughs pretty hard at my jokes. Plus sometimes it does seems she looks at me from across the room but she might be naturally curious about things I really don’t know.)

Both me and my sister[24F] grew up in a poor household that sometimes oscillated in the notsopoor area.
Trough out our childhood our mom was always present there for anything, she is the dictionary definition of a loving mom who made crazy compromises to make us happy and fill the gap that was made by our financial status, often times at her own expense.
She never missed an opportunity to show how much she loves us and raised us up with strong goals in mind.
In the other extreme end, dad never showed any affection towards us.He never did any of the dad stuff with us, he never asks us how is school,how is our personal life, often times not even remember to say happy birthday on our birthdays.In fact I have a joke about how it feels like he is an Airbnb guest in our house.
He isn't a pleasent person, he's the ""I know it all"" person maybe as far as a bigot.
He did a series of deliberate actions which had a deep impact on my mom's health, one of the biggest is pretend he wanted to move to another country with the whole family but lying in official statements so we would get banned from ever entering that country(so he wouldn't have to leave).




&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;





He never earned as much money as my mom, isn't a qualified professional in any field because he couldn't be bothered to learn and often times he earned as little as half of my mom's pay.
In fact he keeps a third of his pay for his personal spendings and often comes home with very expensive clothing and shoes while he never bothers to ask us if we need anything.
When they got married,dad moved in my mom's appartment.




&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Their marriage is failing and has been declining ever since I can remember myself but it hit a low point couple of weeks ago when we found out he has had a mistress for a while and upon finding out he decided to call it quit but not without asking for half of the apartment which in his vision is rightfully his.
This happens at the worst possible time given that both my sister and I are students and we are only couple of years away from being financially independent (due to getting in very sought after fields) but right now with 2 students money is very tight (mom recently had to retire).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;



I knew it was going to happen but I was never ready.I don't even know what will happen next but I decided to not talk to him anymore and not contact him.
But also I feel like I'm in a way too harsh because he's never done something directly towards me, but indirectly that negatively impacted our future.Also he did many things that put a toll on my mom and I cannot forget that.
But I also feel like his lack of presence and interest in us and mountain of selfishness is apalling and only for his actions I'm ready to never talk to him again.
Am I being to harsh?
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

tl;dr:
Dad is requesting for half of the house after never caring about his marriage or his children and being caught with a mistress and I think I'm too harsh to decide that I don't want to talk to him ever again","['dad', '55_m', 'leave', 'want', 'half', 'house', 'bad', 'time', 'possible', 'find', 'mistress', 'little', 'intro', 'sister', '24_f', 'grow', 'poor', 'household', 'oscillate', 'notsopoor', 'area', 'trough', 'childhood', 'mom', 'present', 'dictionary', 'definition', 'love', 'mom', 'crazy', 'compromise', 'happy', 'fill', 'gap', 'financial', 'status', 'time', 'expense', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'love', 'raise', 'strong', 'goal', 'mind', 'extreme', 'end', 'dad', 'show', 'affection', 'us.he', 'dad', 'stuff', 'ask', 'school', 'personal', 'life', 'time', 'remember', 'happy', 'birthday', 'birthdays.in', 'fact', 'joke', 'feel', 'like', 'airbnb', 'guest', 'house', 'pleasent', 'person', 'know', 'person', 'maybe', 'far', 'bigot', 'series', 'deliberate', 'action', 'deep', 'impact', 'moms', 'health', 'big', 'pretend', 'want', 'country', 'family', 'lie', 'official', 'statement', 'ban', 'enter', 'country', 'leave', 'nbsp', 'nbsp', 'nbsp', 'earn', 'money', 'mom', 'qualified', 'professional', 'field', 'bother', 'learn', 'time', 'earn', 'little', 'half', 'mom', 'pay', 'fact', 'keep', 'pay', 'personal', 'spending', 'come', 'home', 'expensive', 'clothing', 'shoe', 'bother', 'ask', 'need', 'get', 'marry', 'dad', 'move', 'moms', 'appartment', 'nbsp', 'nbsp', 'marriage', 'fail', 'decline', 'remember', 'hit', 'low', 'point', 'couple', 'week', 'ago', 'find', 'mistress', 'find', 'decide', 'quit', 'ask', 'half', 'apartment', 'vision', 'rightfully', 'happen', 'bad', 'possible', 'time', 'give', 'sister', 'student', 'couple', 'year', 'away', 'financially', 'independent', 'get', 'seek', 'field', 'right', '2', 'student', 'money', 'tight', 'mom', 'recently', 'retire', 'nbsp', 'nbsp', 'know', 'go', 'happen', 'ready.i', 'know', 'happen', 'decide', 'talk', 'anymore', 'contact', 'feel', 'like', 'way', 'harsh', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'negatively', 'impact', 'future.also', 'thing', 'toll', 'mom', 'forget', 'feel', 'like', 'lack', 'presence', 'interest', 'mountain', 'selfishness', 'apalle', 'action', 'ready', 'talk', 'harsh', 'nbsp', 'nbsp', 'tl;dr', 'dad', 'request', 'half', 'house', 'care', 'marriage', 'child', 'catch', 'mistress', 'think', 'harsh', 'decide', 'want', 'talk']"

813,8j6bvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j6bvu/28m_moved_away_from_girl_she_ended_things_long/,"[28/m] moved away from girl, she ended things long distance, but now she is essentially asking me to make the first move and ask her to take her back. Is love stronger than pride?","I was dating a girl for about nine months. Overall, she was pretty shitty towards me - manipulative, lies etc. Lot of this is, I realized after the fact, was machinations of her extreme insecurity of not being in control, fear of abandonment etc., which is somewhat obvious to people who've been in toxic relationships. She did only once admit how much she took me for granted, after we didn't see each other for three weeks, because she didn't like something I said and went cold on me (about 5-6 months in), and I decided I wanted to keep talking to her, after she blew me off every week. 

Its cliche and often overused but it was one of the love at first sights kind of thing, although she never admitted it. We were both sort of obsessed with each other, not all of that healthy obviously, and felt like soulmates. I've been in a handful of romantic relationships, so I know what is lust or love, and for whatever reason we felt meant for each other. Her manipulation ruined a lot of this, but I just know she was also obsessed with me. However, I'm not a great mate for her on paper, per se, and she always struggled with listening to her brain vs. her heart when it comes to wanting to be with me. 

So I moved away for better career opportunities, which tore us both up. Shortly before I moved, I told her I loved her. I did this because I wanted her to know that I loved her despite me having to move. She didn't reciprocate, which was fine. It could be that she indeed doesn't love me as much as I do for her, or more likely given that my decision to move was already made, she didn't want to be that vulnerable and give that emotion when I was moving away. 

So fast forward to me living in a different state - she told me she missed me, and would send sexy selfies etc, but would also talk about her dating prospects, which was pretty fd up and I shut that down. But since we were never truly bf/gf (which is the way she wanted things to have more control and so she wouldn't feel guilty for sleeping around) and that I wasn't moving back anytime soon, she felt that were obviously going to be seeing other people, so what's the harm in talking about it? If she was going to be texting me during the day and using my time, I felt that that basically constituted we were still in a quasi relationship, but sort of shortsighted by me. I wanted more of don't ask don't tell, but she probably did it to make me jealous.

Then, she chooses to come visit me three months after I moved way, which is no short trip. I didn't ask her to or anything. I of course wanted to see her, but it was very much her doing because she missed me so much. 

By the end of the trip, I was trying to talk to her about what was next for us. We fought here and there while she was visiting. I'm not sure that was part of what was she was going to say next. Her intentions are always vague and confusing, purposely I think, again a control tactic. So I was getting into that do want to try to have a future together, meaning one of us move to the other, and she was shutting it down. She then said that she was just visiting me as friends, and really never traveled much out of her own state. This easily could've been a cover, and seemed like her intention was to hurt. She left, and gave me a passionate kiss goodbye and said I'll miss you etc, which seemed so warped after being so cold about ""us"" on ride to airport. 

After she got back home, the texting and effort to keep connection together started to noticeably slip. She would blatantly ignore my texts and opinions, and would throw in a screenshot of something funny she saw on Tinder. 

Two months after she visited, I basically told her this is pointless to continue if you're going to be like this to me. I egged her on to tell me how she really feels. She pointed to us fighting when she visited (what she was really upset about is that I stood my ground in an argument) and her last line was that she knows that she can't offer me what I want. I accepted it and told her peace. 

She messaged me two weeks later along with something she shared that I hope youre ok. I said ""all good"". I wasn't going to give her anything. I was missing her but very fine. She had a typical break up line and there was nothing else to say, especially since we were across the country from one another. But over the course of the next six months to today, she would send me occasional snaps, like almost all of my IG posts, and even a month ago messaged me about apparently some girl that I'm IG friends with looking at her IG stories (this seemed fabricated after talking to the girl, who I'm seeing and was and now certainly obvious to anyone looking at her social media that we're dating). That was the first time I responded to her fully in a friendly tone. I gave her the opportunity to say something by asking her if everything's good. She was very short and didn't open up. So fk it right?

So given her still interacting with my social media is pretty tame and nothing to hang your hat on. But there is a music listening database site, last.fm, that tracks and stores every song you listen to via Spotify, iTunes etc. We both have a profile and I can see what she plays. Ever since we started dating one another, I know with almost full certainty she plays songs that match her current emotional turmoil and issues. 

I called her out when she used to play songs when we were driving that had obvious messages of how she felt in our relationship, most of it being sad things were ending. I could tell when she was lying when she said she just listens to sad music, and she did the same thing with music when I visited. She once caught me when I opened my laptop and had a page in browser that had lyrics to a song she listened to recently. This was early on in relationship, so she knew that I would look at the music she played, and try to interpret where things stood on a given basis. Its a decent weapon she has, and also a good way to see where she stood. She would play some songs up to four times in a row. When I saw the lyrics, you could see how exactly it related to her. I also play a similar game, and I caught her once with my last.fm profile up. Lot of times what bugs her is when there really is no theme to what I'm playing or its all happy shit. She pointed that out once after we sort of had a small argument, and she said I didn't hear back from you, and saw you were playing electronic music and wondered what/how you were doing. 

Now a lot of this is just her listening to songs that fit her emotional need, very normal, and many of the songs were about her overall life problems and not just me. But I know part of her listening is for me to look. Basically since we ended things, all the songs are about how she wants me back, misses me, angry I'm not giving her anytime and regrets for being so shitty to me. Its night and day the song selections in terms of how blatant they are with the message. Not a great obsession by me -checking her played songs everyday, but I miss her and her playing the songs she plays sort of validates that we really are in love with one another, despite all her bullshit. 

So, it looks like she will never pull the trigger of saying she misses me/wants to see me. She would've done it a long time ago. Its coming up on a year since I moved, and I can tell she's really missing me, as I am with her. Now, if anything were to happen, I would have very strong demands and not give in to her shit at all. That being said, I feel helpless because she will never reach out first (or she would say her sending me an occasional snap was her reaching out). And why would I reach out first when she ended things? I think part of her was seeing how much I would fight for her when she sort of ended things, and I didn't chase her at all. My sister did this with a guy once, she broke up with him to see how bad he wanted her back, and he moved along and she was very hurt he didn't chase her. 
 
TL:DR
So should I reach out to her and tell her my feelings, despite her saying she couldn't give me what I wanted? Is love stronger than pride? I feel I would lose whatever power I gained by succumbing and being the first person to admit how I feel.

Thanks

I certainly had a thing for her, lust or deep friendship feeling, we had chemistry I think. I had rarely felt so bad as on her last day at work. I was a mess that day. 

The thing is that I deeply wanted to meet her outside of the workplace, but I had stop myself from asking her out, because I was shy and telling myself not to date a coworker. It was a difficult time. And to make me even feel worse, she somewhat hinted at wanting to meet me after she had quit. It never happened.

Then, a few weeks later, I went travelling/working abroad. I thought it would be the end of it. But, she got in touch with me through social media and we had nice intelligent conversations. That was killing me, I was on the other side of the planet and it was impossible to meet her. Suddenly, the conversations stopped. She probably moved on or got too busy.

My travels went on until this year, I am back home for a while, after 3 years. Maybe social media is screwing my mind, but I still think of her. Am I being stupid in wanting to meet her again even after all this time? I feel like a creep doing so.

I find out he was on tinder, adding girls (she wasn’t a girl but someone got offend over what she called herself. Fucking snowflakes I wasn’t talking about you so why tf get offended) from tinder to Snapchat, and talking to his ex. I’m still a bit upset about the ordeal but whatever it’s not in the past and he didn’t cheat (well from I know) so I let it go. Besides he says he’s in total love with me and that if he really wanted to cheat he would’ve just left me (I give him that because same. What’s the point in hurting someone just leave them). Anyways I go through his phone here and there because of what happened he said I could (at first he said no because privacy but like wtf were fucking married. I’m not hiding shit from you but you were hiding shit from me so I have a right to check shit here and there...or am I wrong). Well now he’s talking to some old friend of his (all his friends are girls, shoot me). Basically they were catching up and They started to speak on their relationship. He was old her he was going through a divorce. When I questioned him about it he said he was talking about his ex. My bullshit radar went off because he never married his ex, they weee just engaged. To that he said that his ex had went into his old job and said they were married so he just kept it going when him and his friend were talking about their relationship. Well today I checked the convo again and he lied about his whole life (lol I found it abut pathetic but whatever). He basically made himself seem a lot more successful then he is. He said he owns a shop and that he’s a manger of some factory but he isn’t. Then he said that he’s lonely and that girls often wanna come home with him but he says no because he likes money too much. Should I be weirded out or just let it go? I’m not sure what this means? And like I asked him to put up a picture of me on his new Facebook but he said he doesn’t want anyone knowing his business.

817,8j5tqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j5tqw/am_i_being_a_bad_friend/,Am I being a bad friend?,"Hey everyone!

I'd like your opinion on a little something. I've a friend who I've known for over 10 years, and I've always considered her a very good friend. On and off I've even considered her a sister.

I say on and off because this particular friend has decided previously that I wasn't a good enough friend for her and decided to completely cut me out of her life. First time this happened we were about 15, second time we were around 18. Both times she stopped talking to me for over a year, after which she came to my home both times to say she was sorry and wanted us to be friends again. Both times I said yes and I've forgiven her, because we were teenagers.

Fast forward to right now, we're both 23. We were talking normally from time to time until she stopped completely. I tried contacting her four times and got no response. I felt terrible, I didn't know if she was angry with me because we went from messaging often to her disappearing. After two months, she talked to me over the phone, said she's struggling with anxiety and hence why she stopped talking to me. I, again, said it was fine.

After talking for about a week or so she asked if I wanted to meet up with her, I said yes, and she hasn't spoken to me since. It's been almost three weeks.

I know she's struggling, but I've a feeling I can't shake that is telling me I'm really tired of her deciding when we talk and when we stop talking. It hurts, and she knows it hurts, but usually she prioritizes how she feels and then apologizes for the damage she might have caused.  

Am I being a bad friend by not talking to her? Should I shut down this feeling of being tired of this because she's dealing with anxiety and try again to be there for her?

Now, I understand vaginas are self-cleaning and everything, but I don't think it applies to that level. Once she made it clear how important it is, I've just been doing it anyway. Mostly it's okay, definitely not 'fresh', but there's been a time or two where it's been uncomfortable for me.

Not sure at this point. Feel free to decide for yourself. 

Backstory: I (34F) went on an 8 month dating/sex hiatus because I was sick of the bullshit (ghosting, manipulation, nothing but unavailable men being attracted to me) and I returned to the dating scene via Bumble. 

The second bumble date I went on was 3 months ago. We’ll call him Josh. Josh and I had texted back and forth for the week prior and they were GOOD conversations. Philosophical. Not the usual boring, “how was your week” but, “what are your views on xyz”. On our first date, he made a zinger comment before I’d even taken my coat off that just made me feel, “Ooooh. You get me and you can keep up with my humour.” The evening went great and I left feeling like I really wanted to see him again. I haven’t had that feeling after a bumble date in YEARS. And I’ve gone on a lot. 

We went on 2 more dates, each better than the one before and I was starting to let my guard down and develop feelings. Also, i have rather slutty tendencies but I didn’t want sex to complicate this relationship, so I didn’t kiss him until the third date. That’s when he cooked me dinner at his place and afterwards we fooled around quite a bit. 

Following that date, texting slowed a bit then by the end of the week, he sent me the “You’re great but I don’t have time to date right now” text. His life was super busy at the time (he was reno-ing his parents house, planning a big trip and moving) so possibly true, but I also believe, if you want to date someone, you’ll make time.

It’s been 3 months, he’s returned from the trip, moved and his parents place is done (I assume... we haven’t talked). I can’t get him off my mind. He’s become a measuring tool for dates I’ve had since... “do I want to see this person again like I did with Josh?” 

I can’t shake this urge to text him. I have a couple theories of what went wrong, but the truth is, I have no idea. I want another chance. I’m even willing to get rejected again just so I can move on - but that’s not healthy. If he wants to be with me, he’ll be with me. 

What do I do?

TLDR: I can’t find closure after someone I really clicked with noped me.

He's been there 3 days now. We haven't talked much although that is normal and what you'd expect when someone is on vacation. Obviously I understand he's busy and communication is sparse right now. 

Today out of no where he messages me saying he loves it there and that he's having a great time. I tell him that's awesome, I'm happy for him, and all that stuff. He then starts saying random things about how he hates America and if he could he wouldn't come back from the trip. I'm just casual and listening to him, then he starts saying his plan is to come back home and possibly finish college and move there ASAP. A bit panicked I responded saying a lot of people go on vacation and love it and think they'll move there only to realize it won't work out etc., but he was CERTAIN it would and continuously told me he's moving there whether I like it or not.

I said I had no interest in moving there, ever, and that I was getting upset. He left it at ""Well you can either come with me or stay where you are and leave me but I'm moving no matter what. I'm much happier here and the people are much better"". We've never really had any fights, and have always gotten along so this really upset me. I said ""I'm sorry but I'm gonna go"" and went offline. Should I confront him about this or just not bother talking to him?

Me and my ex dated for about 8 months, keep in mind it was going well considering it was long distance. (Over 500 miles away). One day she broke up with me because of the distance but we kept in touch frequently, like almost every day. About 2 months after we broke up she got angry for me texting her, I didn’t know why but she said that she was with another guy and he saw my text. This broke my heart, I still loved her and she had been dating this guy for about a week so far. And I had been planning on moving to where she is, but I haven’t told her yet. So I then told her that and I had a job lined up and school all lined up, and she said she didn’t want that. I know this was dumb of me but I said I was moving anyways because the job would pay for grad school. I then came to visit and look for places to live, she was still dating her current boyfriend and she said we should hangout. I agreed and she met me at my hotel room for a few hours and we talked, nothing happened we just talked. Shen then went home and the next day I took her out for lunch and then went to her place to hangout. On the way back to her place she called me babe a few times but quickly apologized. Once back to her place we sat on the couch and watched tv and we ended up falling asleep with each other on the couch. Looking back this was definitely over the line. We woke up and she went to work and I went back to my hotel and looked for places to live. After she got off work she told me to come over and bring pizza, this was at 12:30 at night and I stayed over till about 2 am. The next day she hung out with her boyfriend and then the day after I was going to leave town to go home. She asked me out for breakfast and I went and I found out she didn’t even tell he boyfriend that I was in town and that she had been hanging out with me and talking to me a lot. This was not ok with me and on the way to take her home I told her she needed to tell her boyfriend that we talk and hangout, because it’s not fair to him or me because it makes me look like the bad guy. She didn’t respond but later that day she called me crying and angry yelling that if she tells her boyfriend it will ruin her relationship and she never even wanted to hangout or talk to me. I told her I was sorry and didn’t mean to put her in this position, even though she should have told him I existed in the first place, her bf doesn’t even know who I am! And she was friends with him when we where dating! I have decided to not talk to her anymore and move in with life. But I’m just wondering what everyone else thinks about this situation and what each person should do. I still don’t think her bf knows about it and I feel guilty. 

UPDATE: so I found out that the guy she is with now, she had been dating since we were together. So she was dating both of us for like 6 months.

We've known each other for about 6 months and recently I started slipping into thoughts of ""Wow she's really great, I think I might like her\-\-Hngggggg."" The ""Hnggggg"" is because I'm 90&#37; sure she doesn't look at me that way.

Here's why: This is also the reason why I typed this up as I couldn't really find a post on here that resembles this situation.

When we first met, I asked her out and we went on a couple dates. She said she didn't really feel a connection and thought we'd be better off as friends. I was pretty bummed, but looking back on it, there were some instances when I didn't feel like we were on the same page. I decided to stay friends with her because I wasn't \*heartbroken\* about it, and she was really cool and mature about breaking things off. Since then we've been talking over text and hung out and had a good time.

...fast forward to the present and now I'm catching feels again. The only reason I can think of is that while we weren't on the same page then, I don't really get that sense these days, because now we've known each other for more than a week \(Hence the remaining 10&#37;.\) I'm debating on whether I should tell her, there really isn't any other girls I could go for instead at the moment, which in my experience is a good distraction from this type of thing.

At the moment, we are going through a bit of a rough time with each other for a couple of reasons. My boyfriend recently graduated with his Bachelor's and got a job right at a month after graduation. This job is stressful and requires him to travel an hour one way to work on top of driving during his workday. I am currently about a year away from graduating with my Bachelor's. I currently work two part time jobs, but I am making next to nothing each month. What I do make goes toward paying for tuition and books, although I am looking to take out a small student loan to cover my remaining year. I am also actively job searching, but nothing is working out right now. 

Since he has to travel so much, my boyfriend wants to get an apartment, and he wants me to come with him. My dilemma is that I would be almost 100% dependent on him. I am fiercely independent, and the thought of him having to cover everything is awful. I've told him that I would move in with him whenever I got something better paying and could take out a student loan, but he doesn't like that idea and gets frustrated with me. Not mad, necessarily but he wants to be able to fix things. 

As a result of the stress of his job and my stress at getting a better job and getting my Bachelor's, we are not communicating as effectively as before and our stress and exhaustion is causing more disagreements than before. We have only actually argued about two or three times, so we have had good communication up until this point.

[21M/F],"Met a girl randomly that also goes to my workplace about two weeks ago. We had a small talk and she mentioned my friend who’s working with me so afterwards I asked him what was her name, followed her on Instagram and she accepted. We kept talking there and moved onto texting.

A few days after we met I went to her office and we hung out a bit. I offered to take her home (she lives about 30 minutes away from me) and she said I can drop her off at a certain junction and that her dad will pick her up from there cause he was on his way home from work anyway. I offered her to come to my home to wait for his dad, and she liked the idea. We sat in the balcony and had a really nice time talking. I then took her to said junction and her dad picked her up. 

We kept talking throughout that week and met a few more times, even sat for coffee throughout work one day. 

Last Thursday she asked me if she could come home with me again, so her parents can pick her up. Then she offered to go to the mall, we grabbed lunch and had a really nice time. I told her to cancel her parents so we won’t be in a hurry and after about an hour in the mall I drove her to her house. 

I used the opportunity to ask her if she wanted to do something nice later this week (didn’t specially say date not to push her off) and she smiled and agreed. I offered Saturday and she said it’ll probably be okay because she has to study for SATs, but we didn’t actually schedule anything. 

Sent her a message on Saturday and she said she already made plans with friends. I played it cool and said “no worries; we can go sometime else”. 

Today she hasn’t spoke to me all day, and only sent a message about an hour ago.

It feels like our chats are really working when we’re meeting face to face, but less on text (she’s barely active there anyway).

I don’t wanna be too pushy but I really like her and would love to take things to a more serious level. How should I approach this? Would love some guidance & tips - I really don’t wanna screw it up. She’s an amazing woman.

Help?,"I'm a 21 year old dude in my last year of college. I'm not really good at mingling with folks my age so getting to know or becoming friends with anyone, let alone women, has never really been easy for me. I'm also not in the greatest physical shape and I'm graduating a year late, so I have quite a few insecurities. But among my small group of  aquaintences, I do have this friend, she is the daughter of a family friend and we've known each other since we were kids. For a while now I can't stop thinking about her and I have romantic feelings towards. We talk once a week or so over text and we share each other's problems, serious ones and not so serious ones; we make jokes, ask about each other's families and life in general. Just recently I talked to her about how I was feeling pretty depressed after attending a graduation/commencement for a different friend who graduated on time and she really encouraged to be more confident and to continue to strive towards my degree and see the positives in my life. I really do love talking to her and encouraging her about her career/life. 

But I don't know if my feelings are genuine. I don't know if I have these feelings because I have no one else I can connect to the same way or if it's because I do love her. And I don't want to say anything to her because I really don't want to hurt her and I don't want to get closer to her to just use her as an emotional crutch. I'm not scared of rejection, I just don't want to be the cause of sadness or stress in her life. 

And because of these thoughts I've been thinking about maybe creating some distance between us, trying to figure out my feelings and my position. But it kinda kills me inside not being able to talk to her. I don't know what to do. So any advice would be appreciated.","['21', 'm', 'know', 'feeling', '22', 'f', 'lonely', 'genuinely', 'like', 'help', '21', 'year', 'old', 'dude', 'year', 'college', 'good', 'mingle', 'folk', 'age', 'get', 'know', 'friend', 'let', 'woman', 'easy', 'great', 'physical', 'shape', 'graduate', 'year', 'late', 'insecurity', 'small', 'group', 'aquaintence', 'friend', 'daughter', 'family', 'friend', 'know', 'kid', 'stop', 'think', 'romantic', 'feeling', 'talk', 'week', 'text', 'share', 'problem', 'one', 'one', 'joke', 'ask', 'family', 'life', 'general', 'recently', 'talk', 'feel', 'pretty', 'depressed', 'attend', 'graduation', 'commencement', 'different', 'friend', 'graduate', 'time', 'encourage', 'confident', 'continue', 'strive', 'degree', 'positive', 'life', 'love', 'talk', 'encourage', 'career', 'life', 'know', 'feeling', 'genuine', 'know', 'feeling', 'connect', 'way', 'love', 'want', 'want', 'hurt', 'want', 'close', 'use', 'emotional', 'crutch', 'scared', 'rejection', 'want', 'cause', 'sadness', 'stress', 'life', 'thought', 'think', 'maybe', 'create', 'distance', 'try', 'figure', 'feeling', 'position', 'kinda', 'kill', 'inside', 'able', 'talk', 'know', 'advice', 'appreciate']"

So we got started talking and it became pretty obvious she was interested in me. So we started texting and eventually she asked me if I wanted to hang out with her sometime. I suggested a movie and she agreed. The prom was coming up. She was going with her ex as friends. The weekend came and she was busy so the movie didn’t happen. I forget what day it was but one day we stayed after school and hung out for a bit. She was messing with my hair and we were talking. It was a good couple of hours. She didn’t mention anything about her ex. Prom happens and from what I heard she was mostly doing her own thing. I didn’t go so I wouldn’t know. After that we were still cool for a bit. We tried to plan a movie again but it didn’t happen. She had a good excuse though. Then something happened. She started taking 10 minutes up to a couple of hours to text me back sometimes. After math class she would always remind me to wait for her so we could walk and talk. She stopped doing this about one or two classes ago. This last Friday I texted her asking if she was busy. No reply until 8pm. It was a bunch of sexual stuff like “fuck me” and shit. It was really out of character. Turns out it was somebody who took her phone. She was with the ex and two other male friends. It’s the next day now and no texts back. I don’t know what to do about the situation. Should I confront her about it? Should I pretend everything is fine?

This has been concerning me for a while now, and I need some advice before going to a psychologist or other specialist.
First of all, I love my girlfriend. I do genuinely care about her, and she is the most important person in my life.
Sadly, last two months were a hell for us. Insecurity, discussions all day, and more insecurity from
her. This brings my feelings down and sometimes I don’t even want to have sex. I don’t see this as bad, since it’s normal for couples to spend a day or two without sex at all... but my GF doesn’t see it that way. She thinks I don’t want her anymore, and that puts even more pressure on me to the point I may have ED issues. 
I’m really scared, because I love her and want things to work out, but I’m afraid she doesn’t get some things that are really important to me such as not putting me pressure to have sex. She has also gained a lot of fat since we’re together, which kind of lets me down, too, but this is a minor issue since I still find her hot, but I’m worried she’ll keep eating like a cow and not take care of herself anymore (she says she will and I believe is aware of that).
I also find myself looking at other girls pretty often and feeling guilty as FUCK because this shouldn’t be happening.

What should I do? I don’t want to say these things to her, I do love her and don’t want to destroy the remaining (little bit) of security she has.

Am I being clingy/entitled, or should I confront her?

I have a massive love hate relationship with my close friend and idk if it’s me going crazy (I’ve been googling borderline personality disorder because I’m wondering if I have it) or my friend is treating me like shit. So I’d really really appreciate hearing other people’s advice before I confront her, incase I’m doing the wrong thing.

I’ll try to give both the bad and good so this isn’t biased

My ex best friend and I used to be super close, she loved hanging out with me, we used to go out heaps together. Then she got a boyfriend. They’ve been dating for 6 months which is long enough to not still be in the honeymoon/ignore all your friends stage. I also have a boyfriend and i still spend time equally between friends, fam, bf

1. She meets up with him all the time but is too busy to meet up with me
Since she got her bf, she’s been spending nearly all of her spare time with him and ignoring me. She meets him nearly every day and because of this she doesn’t have time to hang out with her old friends, like me.

2. Always texts him but takes 3 days to send one word replies to me
and when they’re not together, she’s constantly texting him. She texts him when she’s with me, during class, late in the night. I can barely even get a text out of her. Once she took 10 days to say “yeah it was good” and usually takes 2-3 days to reply with one line answers. More recently, the only texts she’s sent have been asking me for help with her homework. I think she’s using one of our mutual friends for homework help and I don’t like what she’s doing

3. But when we’re together, she’s super nice and we get along amazingly well.
But because I feel so much anger/betrayal/resentment, it’s hard for me to act like I don’t have any harsh feelings towards her. She’s also helped me out with small things, so she’s not entirely selfish. But if it conflicts with her and her boyfriend, she won’t help

4. She always complains about her boyfriend to me, but she loves him more than anyone else. I don’t know why she has to lie about not liking him to me

5. Sometimes I’m a pretty bad texted and only reply the next day. But I do that for everyone. She selectively replies to her bf and ignores almost everyone else.

So what should I do? I’ve been feeling annoyed with her for over a month and the feelings just get worse when I see her abandoning her old friends for her boyfriend’s group. I feel like the mature thing to do is text her and ask her why she took so long to reply, instead of sulking.

But at the same time, people are allowed to choose their friends and if she wants other people, she can ditch me. I just don’t like how she pretends to be super close but then treats me disrespectfully. Please any advice xx

I like this girl; let's call her Mall-Pall.  Sad thing is, Mall-Pall has a boyfriend, Isiah, who she claims she loves but also doesn't love (she only likes the idea of Isiah) and wants to break up with him to go back to her ex (Beckett) who she says she absolutely hates, and wishes she never met. Taking this at face value, you would say she likes Isiah since she always talks about him, but at the same time she acts like she doesn't.
For example, yesterday, me, her brother, and a couple of my friends were hanging out at their house and she comes in (completely normal) and starts talking about how she could seduce any of us in the room, and she would kiss me or Shaun (another guy in the room) and talking about our dick sizes, she sits on me and, rests her head on my shoulder, and even kisses my cheek. But still, she wants to date Isiah. 

Now keep in mind, she's always talking about how she wants to break up with him because she only likes the idea of Isiah and she feels like she was forced to date him, but at the same time she's talking about how he's good for her.
I am very confused about where I fit in this, but it's very obvious i'm in there.

TL;DR A girl I like is dating a guy, who she says is good for her but she wants to break up with, and at the same time she kisses me and rests on me. What's going on?

I am 22 and she is 21. We’ve always kept a long distance relationship as we met in a foreign country for both of us and had to move back to our countries afterwards. Meanwhile, we’ve managed to see each other frequently, from 3 to 7 days every month and almost the whole summer. It’s not always easy but we’ve managed to do the best we could with what we could do until now and we’re fortunate to have been to see each other so often. We’ve made plans to move in together and study in a city in another country, as a next step for our relationship. This moving implies a huge monetary cost for me that I have already committed myself to but there’s a slight chance I might end up not being able to go because of money. While I’ll only move in September to save some money as my school only starts then, she moved two months ago and since then our relationship has been terrible. She started hanging with a group of people that I wouldn’t imagine to be her type, specially because they like to go to raves and take drugs, which is something that we both have always hated and never understood why people did that. I advised her to stop hanging around them otherwise she would get caught up in it too. She didn’t listen and now takes a pill every week when she goes out. I feel like I have no control over her and that she doesn’t care about my opinion. She also makes me feel guilty because she has mentioned she would stop doing it but that she feels the need to rebel and doing the opposite of what she’s told. To me, she’s being very very childish and immature about this. I’m trying to make her realize the dangers of her actions but she doesn’t care and manages to make me feel about it because I judge her and go the wrong way of how I should deal with that.

We were close to breaking up a few weeks ago, but we managed to solve some issues non-related to this when I went to visit her in the new city last week. We promised we would be nicer to each other and try to cherish our great relationship more. Not even a full week after this, she goes and takes drugs again.

Another thing is, I’m pretty sure that her best friend there who is a guy and influences her to do all these kind of shit is in love with her and while I believe she hasn’t or wouldn’t cheat on me, when I saw him last week I totally got the feel he likes her. I’m totally not cool with it but she told me this is what always happens and that she’s used to it and that it’s not her fault, which I get because she’s a very attractive girl, but I just don’t get why keeps on feeding it.

It’s hard to put in such few words so many feelings, but I’ll answer in the comments with whatever you guys feel like you need to know. Right now I’m just looking for some help of what I should and what do you guys think of this because I don’t have much relationship experience neither my friends are able to help me.

844,8j3s1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j3s1l/im_an_emotional_robot_and_dont_know_what_to_think/,Im an emotional robot and don't know what to think or feel,"Heyo, I'm 21m dating a 21f for 3 years now. I want to preface this by saying I really do love my gf, we've been through a lot together and even though im an introvert who likes time alone- being with her (usually) makes me happy. However, I am and have always been an emotional robot- sometimes I just don't feel things I should and most of the time, I don't express it even if I do feel it.

That being said, there are 3 major issues in our relationship that have been there for years and I'm hoping I could get some advice on where to go and how to manage my emotions from here:

1) She has always expressed that she wants to live with me but I really really do not want this (atleast now) because my future is uncertain- I will be in school for a very long time and possibly across the country or in a different country. She doesn't really understand that I cannot commit to living together because I feel it would put a lot of pressure on the relationship and the uncertainty of our academic/professional future really doesn't help

2) Marriage and kids. She is from a rural area and I am not, to her- it is the norm to be married and have kids by like 24 and for me- I don't even want to consider that till late 20s, early 30s. Again, mostly because of the uncertainty of my future.

3) Jealousy. I have always been close to multiple girls and my girlfriend hates all of them, I have tried to comfort her and reassure her, but after 3 years of the same thing it gets really old and I have lost my patience towards it. I've never done anything to break trust in the relationship and she has pushed it once with another guy, despite this- she is upset with how I interact with my female friends even though I never crossed any lines.

The issue is- I don't really feel anything now. We are LDR over the summer when school is done and saying good bye to her was rough and sad for me, I got quite emotional after she left but right now (2 or 3 weeks since I said good bye), I almost feel nothing. I do love her, but we have some really important issues in the relationship that we don't see eye to eye on and I don't know what to do. It seems silly to break up with someone you really love and care for, but it also seems silly to break up with someone who has different expectations of the relationship.

Is it fair to outline these 3 issues to her and ask her to decide on what she thinks? She has expressed concern with all 3 issues too and it upsets both of us, but I kind of feel like im emotional limbo between caring for someone who may not feel comfortable experiencing the lifestyle im going to have for the next 5-10 years.

any help would be awesome, thank you","['be', 'emotional', 'robot', 'know', 'think', 'feel', 'heyo', '21_m', 'date', '21_f', '3', 'year', 'want', 'preface', 'say', 'love', 'gf', 'lot', 'be', 'introvert', 'like', 'time', 'alone-', 'usually', 'make', 'happy', 'emotional', 'robot-', 'feel', 'thing', 'time', 'express', 'feel', 'say', '3', 'major', 'issue', 'relationship', 'year', 'hope', 'advice', 'manage', 'emotion', '1', 'express', 'want', 'live', 'want', 'atleast', 'future', 'uncertain-', 'school', 'long', 'time', 'possibly', 'country', 'different', 'country', 'understand', 'commit', 'live', 'feel', 'lot', 'pressure', 'relationship', 'uncertainty', 'academic', 'professional', 'future', 'help', '2', 'marriage', 'kid', 'rural', 'area', 'her-', 'norm', 'marry', 'kid', 'like', '24', 'me-', 'want', 'consider', 'till', 'late', '20_s', 'early', '30_', 'uncertainty', 'future', '3', 'jealousy', 'close', 'multiple', 'girl', 'girlfriend', 'hate', 'try', 'comfort', 'reassure', '3', 'year', 'thing', 'get', 'old', 'lose', 'patience', 'break', 'trust', 'relationship', 'push', 'guy', 'despite', 'this-', 'upset', 'interact', 'female', 'friend', 'cross', 'line', 'issue', 'is-', 'feel', 'ldr', 'summer', 'school', 'say', 'good', 'bye', 'rough', 'sad', 'get', 'emotional', 'leave', 'right', '2', '3', 'week', 'say', 'good', 'bye', 'feel', 'love', 'important', 'issue', 'relationship', 'eye', 'eye', 'know', 'silly', 'break', 'love', 'care', 'silly', 'break', 'different', 'expectation', 'relationship', 'fair', 'outline', '3', 'issue', 'ask', 'decide', 'think', 'express', 'concern', '3', 'issue', 'upset', 'kind', 'feel', 'like', 'be', 'emotional', 'limbo', 'care', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'experience', 'lifestyle', 'be', 'go', '5', '10', 'year', 'help', 'awesome', 'thank']"

I’ve noticed that sometimes he makes references to being together in the future. They aren’t frequent or very serious. He tends to joke about it. For instance the other day we were talking about how he wants to be a professional sky diver and to be funny he said something like “you can stay at home and look after the kids while I’m out there jumping off planes.” and went on about that. It wasn’t serious, he was clearly joking around but it makes me wonder if he can see us being together for that long? I am 21 and he is 23, so it wouldn’t be that far off. I do love him but I don’t feel like I am thinking that far ahead at all. I work for a design company and he also has mentioned how I will be working for my firm while he is retired and can’t move anymore from his adventurous life. All of these comments are part of jokes and very brief add-ins. I wanted to know what someone else might think.

He'd also said he wanted to kiss me but wasn't sure how I would react. 

Shortly after that he had a close family memeber die and distanced himself. That was about a week ago. We talked and flirted most of the week and made plans to do something Friday but he ended up working late. Kind of agreed to do something Saturday but never heard from him.

He had asked me to hang out earlier in the week but I couldn't because I didn't have a baby sitter. We are both in our twenties and both have children.

My question is why does this guy repeatedly flirt with me and hit on me, tell me that he likes me, and then flake on me? I mean should I just be done now?  Its been 2 weeks since our movie date.

She had big hopes and dreams for her career. And as soon as she found out her whole demeanor changed she started pushing me away, she became depressed. Started feeling emotionless told me to move on. It’s unfair to me, she’s disgusting I deserve better. The list is endless.

He was laid off from his job about a month ago and i've been letting him stay with me.  This was while i was finishing up my final semester of undergrad, mind you.  I felt like he didn't take my work seriously but he was sweet so i let him stay.

Now i am post-grad and have begun working my own full-time job.  My life is starting to take off and this guy is still staying with me.  I try to help him get sublettors for his old apt (couldn't break his lease but it has been too expensive for him to live there because he is unemployed) so he has some money, but he seems to have made minimal effort and has had no success.

I've already had many arguments with him where i essentially ask him to leave, but he always counters and i give in.  It would be one thing if this guy were my life-long love but i know we are not compatible.  I'm fed up and don't know what to do but he is in a tough place and i don't want to hurt him.

Can someone give me advice as to how to stand my ground here??  I know I need to be less accommodating.  Can you please give me some advice?  I think part of why it's hard for me is because he's so much older.  I was initially going to wait until he got back on his feet to break up but it's taking a long time and I need space now, since I'm going through a major transition in my own life.","['22_f', 'break', 'sweet', 'incompatible', 'm33', 'see', 'm33', '5', 'month', 'lay', 'job', 'month', 'ago', 'let', 'stay', 'finish', 'final', 'semester', 'undergrad', 'mind', 'feel', 'like', 'work', 'seriously', 'sweet', 'let', 'stay', 'post', 'grad', 'begin', 'work', 'time', 'job', 'life', 'start', 'guy', 'stay', 'try', 'help', 'sublettor', 'old', 'apt', 'break', 'lease', 'expensive', 'live', 'unemployed', 'money', 'minimal', 'effort', 'success', 'argument', 'essentially', 'ask', 'leave', 'counter', 'thing', 'guy', 'life', 'long', 'love', 'know', 'compatible', 'feed', 'know', 'tough', 'place', 'want', 'hurt', 'advice', 'stand', 'ground', 'know', 'need', 'accommodate', 'advice', 'think', 'hard', 'old', 'initially', 'go', 'wait', 'get', 'foot', 'break', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'need', 'space', 'go', 'major', 'transition', 'life']"

I’ve been thinking about ending my relationship with my bf. We met when I was 15 and he was 17. Through the years, we’ve shared so much and grew together into who we are today. 
I really like him, he’s super nice, respectful, funny, etc. but I think we’ve gotten to a point we may not be as compatible as we once were. The biggest thing that comes to mind is the idea of having kids in the future and past time “hobbies” like drugs. 
He dropped out of college because he lost his financial aid due to skipping class and smoking weed all the time with his friends. He works full time so he is doing something with his life but he doesn’t seem fulfilled. We have lived together since 3 years ago.
He has some mental illnesses that further changes how the relationship functions. He has depression and anxiety and terrible self esteem. I have tried helping but the conversion usually ends with him saying that he doesn’t matter and that I should break up with him. I don’t know if I should keep trying or just give up on him (like the rest of his family)

I have been dating my boyfriend for 9 months now . He is the first guy I slept with the man I have lost my virginity to. We met at work and immediately clicked off . 

He’s 22 and I’m 22.
Now at the beginning I was paying for everything . I stayed most of the time at his place because I live farther away from work and it was the sensible idea to stay the nights with him . So I usually go home on the weekends .

The thing is in the first 3 months of our relationship he visited his ex 3 times. His ex messaged me telling me this ,she found me through social media , and said that he hit her

 . After threatening to break up with him he finally admitted that he went to see her because she has a drinking problem and would threaten to kill herself if he didn’t visit her and she started slapping him which is why he hit her 
.
Anyway ,at the time it was his birthday approaching and I didn’t want to complicate things so we went to Paris for his birthday . He insisted he wanted to go away. Now here is what begun to annoy me . 

We both earn the same salary and I live with him most of the time but the only thing he paid for the Paris trip was his ticket which was £200. I paid for everything else which was £800. My parents are split and he knows that my dad is wealthy so I am fortunate to have him to help me .

So after wards I was beginning to feel he cheated on me with his ex in the beginning but he never did which is what he claims . I don’t know whether I believe that because he said he has been with 20 girls before . He’s also from bulgaria and came to the uk which explains his financial situation .

We went to Italy for 5 days and I bought him designer items and clothes because one day the atttactions and museums were all closed so we decided to go shopping . I wanted h to enjoy the trip so we went shopping ....my fault I know .


We are back working now but he now asks to borrow money from me to help with the bills which I don’t mind but he doesn’t pay me back .
I know he cares about me , I had to have an abortion 6 months in the relationship and he has said that he  wants to have children with me . 

He is planning to take me to bulgaria to see his family but I don’t really want to start paying for everything and asking my dad for money .
The thing is , I love him a lot .

me and this guy

We've been dating for about a year on and off. Sometimes he's ok, other times the things he does and says are questionable. 



We went on holiday together, he organised the whole thing since prior to that I wasn't happy with him and was pretty much ignoring him for a month. He said let's start again and it can be a new chapter, so I agreed to go away with him. 



Since we got back i've just been analysing and questioning why to put it mildly he's such a d**k



First day was good, we got on fine. Then he started doing and saying somethings which were out of order and pretty much made me not want to be there with him. 

1. everywhere we went he would leave me trailing behind him trying to catch up, he would just walk and not even consider if im behind him or not. one time I lost him and spent about half an hour contemplating if I should go just end the day and go back to the hotel or carry on looking for him. Only for him to come out and say he's been watching me going up n down the whole time, much to his amusement. I didn't find that very funny.



2. We went to one of the hotel nights, he found a nerdy looking guy and said that guy is you. Why don't you go chat him up, he said it jokingly. when I said ok then I will he suddenly changed and said he doubts he would give you me a chance anyway since the women he's been dancing with are of a different level, implying im unattractive in comparison. 



3. He also was sitting there all moody simply because I didn't have a drink with him at that bar



4. This was probably the worst one and put me in a bad mood all day to the point I didn't even want to dress up or anything, I was actually nearly in tears but I hid it.

We got up headed to breakfast at the hotel, granted I was too tired to make an effort like I do usually when I go out out. 

so its a buffet breakfast where there's hundreds of people and he sat there making comment after comment about my appearance, to the point where I felt absolutely self conscious. 

he's lik so I woke up today to find out you have a double chin, how did you hide it so well all this time. im actually slim and people are constantly saying Iv got a good figure . he's like someone's been eating a bit too much. 

I defended myself.and said you need to get.an eye test, he was like if only you could see yourself right now. ( implying how terrible I look). 

I said I could always count on you for a compliment, he's like if there's anything to compliment I would. and by the way he never compliments me anyway, ever. 



For me that was the icing on the cake and the rest of the holiday I just kept going through his scathing words and couldn't comprehend his rudeness. 

I'm used to strangers and everyone I know always saying how beautiful I am and how pretty I am and the person I decide to spend most my time with keeps attacking my appearance. 



The reason I didn't go over all that with him is simply because I just wanted to appear tough as if it didnt bother me. but really it's the opposite. 



Oh yeh and another thing, on the journey home he ws driving me in his car and he started making jokes about how people look in my area and I threw a scrunched up piece of paper at him in a playful way, he then switched and very aggressively threw it back and told me to pick it up, pick it up now. when I did he said good you're learning how to be disciplined.



I'm always nice to him but his level of disrespect is just getting to me now but at the same time I don't want to act like it got to me so instead ill just end up avoiding him. SINCE we got back he's been messaging me n iv not replied.

I have pretty much no experience in these things and it's hard for me to understand my own feelings.

It's been 6 weeks of slowly building up \*something\* \(we're both very introverted\) and I think I'm reaching a point where I have to make this ""decision"" of sorts.

We've been serious and are looking to get married in a couple of years. A little backstory: my mom did not like him much at first but warmed up and my mom's boyfriend has liked him from the start.

My mom and her boyfriend [50s F,M]  have been dating for 5 years, engaged for 4. They just bought a house together 2 years ago and have been living together more or less for 3 years. I am staying at their house until I finish my degree or earn a raise - whichever comes first. I do not pay any rent but I buy almost 100% of my stuff for the house.

My boyfriend used to stay over sometimes on the weekend until early morning and leave before they get up. Eventually this upset them and my mom comes to tell him he should be leaving by 1-3AM every night he is over.

My boyfriend is upset and frustrated because ""they are not married either"".  He understands that I'm in a rough position and doesn't hold me against me. But I fear that he'll grow to resent them for this. 

Is this a reasonable response from either side? How could I mitigate any of this and hopefully smooth out things between them? I don't want a sour relationship between my future husband and parents. 

I also know that a lot of answers will be ""just move out if you want to live by your own rules"". I'm mainly looking for a way to smooth relationships until that moment.


TL;DR - My parents are getting stricter with a curfew. I do not pay anything towards their house that I live in. My boyfriend is upset that ""there are double standards"".

However we never got the chance to spend time together as a couple as I had to leave for college but within the first few weeks of college we both told each other that we were committed to each other.

Fast forward to this week, I had realized that she was being cold to me for a while recently and I talked to her about it. She told me that she'd just been feeling really tired the past few weeks and that she just didn't feel like talking to anyone in general. Then she told me that her feelings towards me had faded. I asked her if she still had feelings towards me and she said she did but after talking to her for a while, she told me that she actually wasn't sure about her feelings as there was another guy she'd recently grown close to who has made her unsure of her feelings. She says that she just doesn't know anything anymore. She doesn't know if she likes me, or if she likes him or if she doesn't like either one of us. She told me to move on because she didn't want to hurt me or make me feel like I was a backup. She told the other guy to move on too. However I've told her that I can't move on yet because I don't want to due to the relationship that we'd prior to this incident, it just didn't provide me a convincing enough reason to move on as I feel that there is still hope. I told her that both of us should take a break from talking to each other until she figures it out but she told me that she didn't know when she could do that as figuring this out wasn't going to be her priority as she had to focus on her exams (SPM which is the final exam to take before leaving high school in Malaysia). I told her that it's fine and that it shouldn't be her priority as she should focus on her exams and herself whereas I myself would need to focus on college, hence the break that we need to take from talking to each other. 

What are your opinions on my situation right now?? And what should I do?

We fight weekly, if not more, over what he thinks and sees are little things. The fights end with me feeling bad and scrambling to fix myself. He doesn't see the point in trying, he hasn't for a couple years now. I've been trying for months to fix stuff between us, but I'm tired after managing the house, the babies, my job. I don't know how to say anything without hurting him and he feels the same way about taking to me. Any advice appreciated. We tried counselling once and I thought it was nice. He thought nothing new was said and it was for me only. Is it me? I'm not sure what more I can do","['hubbie', '34_m', '25_f', 'have', 'rocky', 'time', 'bad', '5', 'year', 'married', '2', '2', 'kid', '2', 'love', 'like', 'rough', 'job', 'year', 'ago', 'mess', 'thing', 'decide', 'stay', 'home', 'kid', 'birth', 'second', 'child', 'work', 'time', 'home', 'play', 'time', 'mom', 'cook', 'clean', 'sit', 'evening', 'cope', 'stress', 'toddler', 'clean', 'day', 'thing', 'rocky', 'especially', 'finance', 'chore', 'stress', 'end', 'regular', 'basis', 'overwhelmed', 'sad', 'grumpy', 'weakness', 'upset', 'disappointment', 'get', 'anxious', 'confrontational', 'communication', 'break', 'course', 'emotional', 'defensive', 'stress', 'bubble', 'fight', 'weekly', 'think', 'see', 'little', 'thing', 'fight', 'end', 'feel', 'bad', 'scramble', 'fix', 'point', 'try', 'couple', 'year', 'try', 'month', 'fix', 'stuff', 'tired', 'manage', 'house', 'baby', 'job', 'know', 'hurt', 'feel', 'way', 'take', 'advice', 'appreciate', 'try', 'counselling', 'think', 'nice', 'think', 'new', 'say', 'sure']"
866,8j2cvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j2cvn/should_i_break_up_with_him_or_am_i_being_an/,Should I break up with him or am I being an insecure little biatch!?,"Ok, so a little background info, im 26 and for like a year i was going on all sorts of dates trying to meet someone right for me. Nothing seemed to be working out because i just didnt feel a connection with any of them and if i finally did they didnt feel the same way about me. So i finally met my now boyfriend 30 y/o like 6.5 months ago and it was seriously SOOO good in the beginning. We both talked about how we felt like it was destined for us to meet eachother because we had so much in common and we had this amazing chemistry. 

We went on a few dates but a lot of the time we were just happy sitting at home together and enjoying eachothers company. Not to mention our sex life was seriously CRAZY GOOD!! After a couple months i realized that all he ever really wanted to do was sit at home and even when i asked if he wanted to go out and do something he would say hed rather just hang out at home. i enjoy going out and being social but i just looked past it because he made me so happy and i didnt care as long as i was with him. 

Another month or so goes by and i realize hes not really texting me much anymore, like just one “just wanted to say hi” kind of text a day and even when we did hang out i felt like he was being distant from me, we would spend the whole weekend together but he just acted like he wasnt even interested in me anymore. We kinda just sat there and watched tv all day and didnt have as deep of conversations and we definitely werent having sex much anymore let alone him even giving me a kiss the whole weekend or grabbing my hand while watching a movie. I tried talking to him about it asking if he was unhappy or just not interested anymore or what and he insisted everything was fine. But actions spoke louder than words and i ended up breaking up with him. 

A couple weeks later he reached out to me and we ended up talking all night, he said that he has depression and he goes through phases where he just doesnt feel happy or excited about anything and that it had nothing to do with me he just couldnt help that he got like that from time to time. He was saying all these things like he wished he would have done things differently and if hes ever lucky enough to find another girl like me he would do whatever he had to to show them every day that he loves them. I felt horrible like i gave up on him too soon so i took him back. 

Things were amazing again just him and i hanging out together for another month or so then he went into another “depression” i could tell that’s what it was because all he wanted to do was sleep all the time and he wouldnt even touch his guitar which i KNOW he loves. So this time i just gave him space and told him not to worry about it and that i just want him to feel better, which after awhile i could tell he was starting to snap out of it and act normal again but he still wasnt being affectionate with me or texting me or really showing he cared about me at all. It even got to the point where if i wouldnt text him first we would go 2-3 days without talking at all. 

We dont see eachother much during the week so we would always spend the weekend together but then there were two weekends in a row recently where he said he was too busy with stuff around the house to hang out and “to be honest he kinda just wanted to be alone those weekends.” So ive brought these things up to him many times and he always says he doesnt want to lose me and that he does very much care about me even though i havent felt it much lately. He says that thats just how he is, hes not affectonate and sometimes he just wants to be alone(even tho weekends are the only time we see eachother) but he says hes lost girlfriends because of it because they dont understand which just makes me feel bad when he says that like i think “he does want to be with me why cant i just be happy with what i have?” 

I’ve talked to him about all this and how it doesn’t even seem like he likes me and i mentioned we werent even having sex anymore and that is one thing that got better, our sex life started being amazing again but if we werent having sex i just got this feeling like he wasnt even happy i was there and it didnt seem like he even wanted to hang out anymore, weve definitely been hanging out less and less and part of that is my fault because i dont make the plans but thats just because i get such mixed signals from him. i mean the last month ive been feeling like this and i bring it up to him a lot but he always says thats just how he is but then he will throw something really sweet in there and i just get sucked back in. 

Fast forward to today we were supposed to hang out but he ended up having to do this one little thing with his guitar first that ended up in him driving 2 hours away and spending the whole day in the cities because he just felt like getting something extra for his guitar, he finally texts me at 10pm so needless to say we didn’t even hang out. So AGAIN i bring it up to him how he doesnt seem like he cares and of course the whole thing gets brought up how he doesnt even seem interested when i do spend time with him blah blah.. 

This time he straight up tells me that everything is in my head and that in his eyes our relationship is perfectly normal and that 100% of our problems are only because i THINK there are problems. He said he doesnt want to lose me but he doesn't think anything needs to change because hes already been trying so hard to change to make me happy...( ? I guess he means cuz we started having sex again and that’s just because he knew it was bothering me, which really its so much more than just the sex..) but hes saying how obviously things are going to be fireworks and lusting over eachother 24/7 in the beginning and that its perfectly normal to act like we do after 6 months of dating.... but im not so sure, i mean obviously i know that has some truth to it but honesyly 6 months is not that long, not to mention we already broke up once and its probably been like over 2 months all together that i have felt like this. 

I just feel like it’s too early for there to be no excitement left in our relationship. Im just so confused because when its good its really good and the thought of losing him completely is hard to swallow. He’s saying he wants to be with me and hes sorry hes not affectionate but if we break up its 100% my doing because he did “eveything he could to make me happy and just couldnt” so yea. Honestly i dont know if im just being insecure and want all this un-needed attention or if these are serious red flags. I really dont know but Any advice is appreciated<3","['break', 'insecure', 'little', 'biatch', 'ok', 'little', 'background', 'info', 'be', '26', 'like', 'year', 'go', 'sort', 'date', 'try', 'meet', 'right', 'work', 'not', 'feel', 'connection', 'finally', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'finally', 'meet', 'boyfriend', '30', 'y', 'o', 'like', '6.5', 'month', 'ago', 'seriously', 'sooo', 'good', 'beginning', 'talk', 'feel', 'like', 'destine', 'meet', 'eachother', 'common', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'go', 'date', 'lot', 'time', 'happy', 'sit', 'home', 'enjoy', 'eachother', 'company', 'mention', 'sex', 'life', 'seriously', 'crazy', 'good', 'couple', 'month', 'realize', 'want', 'sit', 'home', 'ask', 'want', 'd', 'hang', 'home', 'enjoy', 'go', 'social', 'look', 'past', 'happy', 'not', 'care', 'long', 'month', 'go', 'realize', 's', 'texte', 'anymore', 'like', 'want', 'hi', 'kind', 'text', 'day', 'hang', 'feel', 'like', 'distant', 'spend', 'weekend', 'act', 'like', 'not', 'interested', 'anymore', 'kinda', 'sit', 'watch', 'tv', 'day', 'not', 'deep', 'conversation', 'definitely', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'anymore', 'let', 'give', 'kiss', 'weekend', 'grab', 'hand', 'watch', 'movie', 'try', 'talk', 'ask', 'unhappy', 'interested', 'anymore', 'insist', 'fine', 'action', 'speak', 'louder', 'word', 'end', 'break', 'couple', 'week', 'later', 'reach', 'end', 'talk', 'night', 'say', 'depression', 'go', 'phase', 'not', 'feel', 'happy', 'excited', 'not', 'help', 'get', 'like', 'time', 'time', 'say', 'thing', 'like', 'wish', 'thing', 'differently', 's', 'lucky', 'find', 'girl', 'like', 'day', 'love', 'feel', 'horrible', 'like', 'give', 'soon', 'take', 'thing', 'amazing', 'hang', 'month', 'go', 'depression', 'tell', 'want', 'sleep', 'time', 'not', 'touch', 'guitar', 'know', 'love', 'time', 'give', 'space', 'tell', 'worry', 'want', 'feel', 'well', 'awhile', 'tell', 'start', 'snap', 'act', 'normal', 'not', 'affectionate', 'texte', 'show', 'care', 'get', 'point', 'not', 'text', '2', '3', 'day', 'talk', 'not', 'eachother', 'week', 'spend', 'weekend', 'weekend', 'row', 'recently', 'say', 'busy', 'stuff', 'house', 'hang', 'honest', 'kinda', 'want', 'weekend', 'have', 'bring', 'thing', 'time', 'say', 'not', 'want', 'lose', 'care', 'not', 'feel', 'lately', 'say', 's', 's', 'affectonate', 'want', 'tho', 'weekend', 'time', 'eachother', 'say', 's', 'lose', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'understand', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'say', 'like', 'think', 'want', 'not', 'happy', 'talk', 'like', 'like', 'mention', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'anymore', 'thing', 'get', 'well', 'sex', 'life', 'start', 'amazing', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'get', 'feeling', 'like', 'not', 'happy', 'not', 'like', 'want', 'hang', 'anymore', 'have', 'definitely', 'hang', 'fault', 'not', 'plan', 's', 'mixed', 'signal', 'mean', 'month', 'have', 'feel', 'like', 'bring', 'lot', 'say', 's', 'throw', 'sweet', 'suck', 'fast', 'forward', 'today', 'suppose', 'hang', 'end', 'have', 'little', 'thing', 'guitar', 'end', 'drive', '2', 'hour', 'away', 'spend', 'day', 'city', 'feel', 'like', 'get', 'extra', 'guitar', 'finally', 'text', '10', 'p.m.', 'needless', 'hang', 'bring', 'not', 'like', 'care', 'course', 'thing', 'get', 'bring', 'not', 'interested', 'spend', 'time', 'blah', 'blah', 'time', 'straight', 'tell', 'head', 'eye', 'relationship', 'perfectly', 'normal', '100', 'problem', 'think', 'problem', 'say', 'not', 'want', 'lose', 'think', 'need', 'change', 's', 'try', 'hard', 'change', 'happy', 'guess', 'mean', 'cuz', 'start', 'have', 'sex', 'know', 'bother', 'sex', 's', 'say', 'obviously', 'thing', 'go', 'firework', 'lust', 'eachother', '24/7', 'beginning', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'act', 'like', '6', 'month', 'dating', 'be', 'sure', 'mean', 'obviously', 'know', 'truth', 'honesyly', '6', 'month', 'long', 'mention', 'break', 'probably', 'like', '2', 'month', 'feel', 'like', 'feel', 'like', 'early', 'excitement', 'leave', 'relationship', 'be', 'confused', 'good', 'good', 'thought', 'lose', 'completely', 'hard', 'swallow', 'say', 'want', 's', 'sorry', 's', 'affectionate', 'break', '100', 'eveythe', 'happy', 'not', 'yea', 'honestly', 'not', 'know', 'be', 'insecure', 'want', 'un', 'need', 'attention', 'red', 'flag', 'not', 'know', 'advice', 'appreciated<3']"

870,8j219z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j219z/from_friendzone_to_falling_short/,From friendzone to falling short.,"Right ladies, gents and whatever you choose to associate with. I need some advice.

I started my best friend of 8 years about 7 months ago, yip I climbed out the friend zone.
Everything has been going fantastically and I love her to pieces. We worked out a lot of unnecessary shit but one problem keeps recurring. The Issue of time.

As some background: we're both final year students studying on different campus's that are 15-20 mins apart to drive. I live with my parents and she lives alone. For the first 6 months of our relationship I, admittedly, was very unresponsive to going out to events spending nights with her and spending weekends with her parents (divorced so any respective parent as it were at the time) because I have an abusive alcoholic and very controlling mother who has the master manipulative tendency of a god. She also dislikes my GF and makes a point to voice these views daily. Therefore, my GF cannot visit my house. If I do something to displease her, any privilege I have will be revoked by my father. So, I try to stay out of her line of fire as much as possible. At least, until I get some decent work next year and get TF outta here.

Anyway, of late, I decided to grow a pair and go out more and just enjoy my life, especially with my GF. I have an incredibly shit month of work due before mid-year exams but I have managed to see her twice a week. Involving one dinner date and a friday afternoon up until Saturday evening. This was, unfortunately, the time I could afford this work to comfortably spend with her and enjoy her time without stressing about life. But, which seems to happen often, I get a message when I leave. So no matter how much time I spend with her, it feels like I never give enough you know?

In a summarised version, the message states that she's tired of being alone every Saturday night and that she feels like nothings changed since we started dating. She feels like I don't put in the effort to see her and that I don't genuinely have an affinity to spend more time with her as well as I lack ""spontaneity"" to see her. She is aware of my family situation at home, so I try to explain that this is one hell of a shit month and that I am making as much time to spend quality time with her as possible. It's not that I don't want to, it's just that its difficult. I also asked why I always have to ""initiate"" plans or be spontaneous in this regard. She proceeds to hammer on her point without reading what I was trying to say. She then informed me what I should have said to avoid an argument, upsetting since I should speak for myself I guess? And when I enquire as to why such concerns are raised over whatsapp instead of in person, she responds Im not there enough to talk to me, eventhough I had effectively just seen her for a day and a half. 

Look, I do understand where she's coming from, she lives alone without anyone around and she's developed a deep sense of loneliness. Unfortunately, I currently don't have the financial or timeous capacity to completely fulfil this need of hers. Which hurts me deeply as you can imagine. As this issue is raised often, I've developed a frustrative attitude towards the situatuon which causes all conversations we have (over text) to go nasty cause I get snappy and rude. 

I know this is one side of the story only, which is why I don't paint her in a bad light. I love her immensely but I don't know what to do or say any more. I tried speaking to her mom, who told me I need to give her some ""structure"" so I tried to see her every Friday night at the minimum. It failed obviously. 

If anyone has any suggestions, similar experiences or ideas as to what I can try, I would be extremely appreciative.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 months (we're both 19) he's great, literally no complaints he's genuine and trustworthy and treats me well but what he done last night really hurt me. he ended up hanging out with his ex girlfriend, they were both alone. I ended up seeing it on his story - it was just a video of them laughing together over something. He has plenty of friends girls and guys and I've never had issues with any of that obviously but the fact that this time it's him with his last ex girl is something that's really upset me.

She used him multiple times and really hurt him.. why I don't like her in the first place. I told him before I didn't think he should be cool with someone who treat him like that in the past but I always left that up to him but finding out they hung out alone last night really bothered me.

Sometimes we’d interact, discuss the test, how we plan to study, etc. it’s mever been more than an acquaintance-relationship and I had never really seen her as anything more, nor I was interested in pursuing anything.

On Thursday, a noticeable amount of the class was gone taking an AP exam. I was on my tablet playing a game trying to pass the time, when she came over and asked me what I was doing. I’m an introvert, fairly shy, and was taken by surprise at the whole girl-coming-up-to-me aspect of things. She spent the next few minutes developing a tag-team strategy for us to play the game. Maybe I’m just a weirdo, but it was cute how she was putting effort into trying to make this single player game a two player one.

We messed up in the game and we playfully argued that it was the other one’s fault. We spent the next 30 minutes of class just talking about class, our upcoming exams, etc. As we left to our next class she walked with me and asked me my schedule and If I would be interested in walking with her after class every few days.

I had never really spoken more than three minutes with this girl before. And even though I realize this was more than likely her way of being friendly, I’ve completely fallen for this girl. She’s a complete nerd like me, she’s awkwardly hilarious (sort of like me, although I don’t consider myself hilarious), and she’s a musician like myself.

873,8j1rv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j1rv1/just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_and_it_kind_of/,Just broke up with my girlfriend and it kind of messes me up.,"She had this problem of self-centering herself all along and she still was at the end of our relationship.

I'm an egalitarian and I believe it is necessary for both sides to make efforts in a relationship rather than me constantly feeding her my love or my emotions.

The situation got worse when I had a big disease. During the two weeks I became extremely paranoia that I may die from the disease as I did not know what it was. I went to hospitals several times and got really paranoid for it because of the ignorance I have for this disease. 

The disease started soon after we first met each other. I caught a heavy cold, based on my experience, cold can be healed within a week. However this time it didn't. 

So I started to pinpoint the problems come from my girlfriend as she did not look very healthy to me. I got even more paranoid. I thought of some crazy STDs shit.

During this time, I could not hold myself being a happy person to her anymore. I started to yell at her and also enduring my own anxiety coming from the disease. 

I thought I could not make it and my girlfriend, not knowing how bad my health was still constantly trying to contact with me. I knew it was not going to end well if she tried to seek my affections, which I couldn't afford anymore due to my health conditions. 

She was not with me at the time, we communicated loosely on message app. So after I explained the situation to her, I asked her to take a break from me and not come to find me anymore. Wait for me to heal up. 

However, the disease just couldn't get better, it worsened every day. I got more and more paranoid every day and I knew I was not in my best mood and best health conditions. 

I asked her to go check her body as I thought there was something wrong with it so I got infected by it. She was reluctant to do so since her economic status does not allow. Yes she's poor, that's why mostly I afforded the things when we went out. 

I couldn't stop my paranoia to go haywire, and I understood deeply that there's a cause and a consequence. So I constantly tried to figure out what was going on with myself. 

I sought doctors multiple times and took pills from them, it did not heal better. 

In the final turn, she went out and took a very small examination of herself and she found no problems at all. So she went completely psycho on me that I accused her of infecting me. However the whole time I just tried to seek a solution to my disease so that I can heal up faster and can meet her soon. 

This 2 weeks block-out really fucked up our relationship as we had always been meeting each other from time to time due to our distance.

I don't know what was wrong with me but I really couldn't afford anything when my health went bad. Not a smile, not a visit, not a gift. 

I thought for her all along the relationship, she took it for granted and scarcely thought for me. 

I escorted her every time to the transport station when she left. She did not at once try to see me leaving her to the far away station.

Even till the end, I knew my paranoia went out of hand. But something she said still hurts me—she thought she being checked up was an act of come clean, to prove herself not being dirty. But I did not assume and even dared to tell her she's dirty at all, I just wanted to know her health condition that was all. 

Once she got her examination paper, she texted me and I was resting, so I did not respond to her at once. Then she texted that she wanted to break up, and soon she blocked me, rejected my phone calls. I found it really low of her doing stuff like this. When I woke up looking at the angry messages she sent me, I felt really out of world. I texted her I was resting, she blocked my account. I started calling her, yet she also blocked my number. I found it no way to contact her immediately as she did not even want to hear about my thoughts. Finally I got to contact with her another account and she started to listen to me very very reluctantly. And constantly telling me that she had nothing to do with my disease, and saying she's not dirty. I didn't know why she had to act this way, I just told her to try to pick up the phone, not texting me or listening to my voice messages. She refused. In the end I called her, but I had nothing for her anymore due to her behaviors. Before calling her, I somehow felt unnecessary to explain anything to her, I found it meaningless to do so. But anyway I still explained it to her, with a slow pace as my back was aching. She accepted it and silenced most of the time, in the end she hanged up the phone. That's when I knew it was all over. 

I find it really hard to respond to her while she's been so self-centric all the time. Her friends backed her, she felt very confident in confronting me with little knowledge to none other than a single examination paper. I have tons of paper behind as I went to hospitals multiple times trying to identify the disease. And I still did not intend to escalate the problem to whether I thought she may be dirty or not. I explained my thoughts for her, and she accepted, but she said she could not stand it anymore. 

Well I guess that's it. I just can't do it when someone is so self-centric and I have to put up a smiley face 24/7. That's tiring......

EDIT: We had sex, a lot of sex. That's why I thought I might get infected with some stupid STD. But I didn't really believe it as I used a condom every time we had sex.

My brother has had a rather troubling middle and high school experiences. Not in terms of making friends (he can be friends with almost ANYONE) but school authority. While the private school he attended until high school was awful at treating children equally (especially those of a different racial and economic group), he’s never really taken well to authority figures. I believe a major contributor is his relationship with my father(61M) (who is far from perfect). Long story short,  tensions between the two got to the point where my brother ran away from home for about 2 days and my dad basically told him “not to come home” when my brother expressed reasonable discontent with my father’s “child rearing”. (This happened last year) It’s ridiculous. My parents also fought about whole situation and the conclusion was my brother is now my mom’s “responsibility”. 

What makes matters worse is that my brother lacks motivation when it comes to school. He’s been doing better from what I’ve been told but he consistently has to try and pass classes by turning in missing work at the end of term. It’s not even like he can’t do! He’s just not motivated to care. He also expressed “hating his life” to me earlier this year... and possibly being suicidal. I know he’s not happy with his current situation. I try to encourage him to pursue his school so when he goes to college, he can have his pick at any school he wants and go as far as he’d like. Unfortunately that’s probably hard him (like many high schoolers) to see past the present and look forward to tomorrow. 

My mom has REALLY been trying to steer my brother in the right direction. I came home from college this weekend and she told how the little sparks of when my brother is obedient and interest in science has been surprising and encouraging her of a better future for him. However, after learning that he smoked weed (and possibly other things???) tonight and didn’t tell her where’d he be; she went straight to her room after scolding him without saying anything else. She was disappointed and it was disheartening to watch. 

My family has a lot of issues and I’m not really sure how I can effectively motivate my brother or show my mom support. I know weed can be used recreationally but he’s underage and with his current history, smoking it isn’t going to help him. Any advice would be appreciated. 

TLDR: My little brother has a troubling past, isn’t doing great in school, and got caught having smoked weed by my mom. Not sure what to do in this situation.

We are both 2nd years at UCLA. Her ex currently is in Australia doing some internship or something. Anyways, he might or might not be coming back to UCLA the next school year. He's biz-econ :P

Reasons she broke with him: he's an asshole, he did stuff (though she says she thinks it wasn't full on intercourse) with other girls, he kept telling her to workout, wear makeup, wear more prettier/promiscuous outfits, and probably most importantly, he kept asking her if she wanted to have an open relationship (so he can do stuff with other girls) until she couldn't take it anymore and decided to break it off.

Reasons of why she says she still keeps in contact with him: She said he still gets her and all of her idiosyncrasies, she still finds him interesting. She says she still loves him. 

In the end, she thinks he's an asshole and a fuckboy (which he is I think) but she says to me that she doesn't know what to do. I told her I did not like this at all since their relationship ended on such heart breaking terms. I told her I was uncomfortable that she still texts him regularly and keeps in contact. I told her all of this and kindly asked her not to speak to him anymore at all, but she has no answer for me. I hinted at a break and she cried and felt sad. I don't know what to do.

To give some backstory, my fiance and I have been going through a rough patch, her father is I'll and family is relocating all over. Our relationship has been suffering. Through all this, her best friend has been the one she turns to for all her support. He had been across the country for a while, but now he's in the area again and all of a sudden she is leaving her daughter and I to spend evenings out partying with him and get other friends, which she claims is just catching up (which I half believe).  However, her father is having to be shipped to another hospital in another town for treatment (only 2 hours away).  She is talking about dropping everything to move to this town in order be able to support him and her mother. She plans to take our daughter with her.  I have a good job that requires me to commute in the opposite direction so I would have to stay where we are.  I recently discovered that her friend is moving to the same town as her father's new hospital and there has been talk of sharing a place.

When she is happy, is wonderful to be with but when she is depressed it can be tough to deal with. 

She is a little on the needy side, which can get frustrating when I need alone time but whenever she is alone, she starts to freak out and get really depressed. She doesn't force me to come to her or anything, she just complains about being alone and how she can't keep going on because she is so anxious about the future like classes and what not.

The other thing is that is really tough is that she really has cut herself off from all other people except me. She also is really afraid to ever go out anywhere because she can't get over her anxiety or insecurities (not sure which it is). 

It really brings me down being with her sometimes but I know that when she is happy, we do really well together. Any advice?

My wife and I are getting married for over 4 years now, we have being in relationship for over 10years now

We have 2 young kids ( 2 and 3 years old ) As we can imagine life with 2 Youngs ones are becoming harder for a couple like us ( she is 30, and I’m 36)

Over the all 10years relationships it has been all ok kind of emotions; from cheating at each other to hurting each other for not trying to underhand one of us

Back in December I have brought one my friend who was visiting me, he stayed over 2 months there Due to my job I had to leave my City for a month ( since my job is related to the season of the year , and that December is my best month of the year ; so I had leave her with some help B.B. siter helping her most of the time ;)

When I came for Christmas I found her different, to the point that I discovered that she had cheated on me and slept with the friend of mine ( this to me was a blow on my face, I couldn’t accept that idea that she did that and that friend let himself doing it , because apparently she was the one who initiated and wanted to have that affair with that guy It took me 2 months to try turning that page and accept what she has done, we were in the need of some change so we decided to get a new place which help us to move on a little a bite

Then early April I just discovered that she was trying to look for that guy , by google where is the City this guy is coming from ... then another 2 weeks after that by April 15, she mentioned at me that I was not giving the attention that she needs and was feeling not too happy about it

Around that time we have another argue, and right after that story she went into dating web site to find for other connexions She spoke with a guy online, and exchange explicit pictures of herself and had a couple of explicit / sex conversation with that guy late night 3/4am

I discovered her game by April 20, and she was still disrespecting to me in my house with my kids ( locking herself in the bathroom using what’s up with that guy, and sending private pics of hersel to that guy )

She then brought to me the idea of a threesome , and that she had met this guy online and is willing to do it if I was ok

I just then took her phone to invistagate more, and was just feeling and still feel horrify by that idea ( I just can’t conceive that idea, and I’m not ready for it )

We went to see a couple therapist a couple of times in between, I explain my concern same for her ( she basically was trying to say that since that I have being cheating on her a couple of times, and that she have done the same with me , then she feels that the mariage relation is broken , which I totally agreed and understand, but I don’t understand now what does she have in mind

If she thinks that the mariage relationship is broken why she still wants to stay with me ? And still looking for other male dating connexion ? Why she is pretending doing a threesome ( if at the end I feel it would be only for her own pleasure ?, I even mentioned to her ok if we do a threesome then it can be with another girl too ? She says she can be open of doing a girl, but for that moment that she will prefer doing a man, and on top of that that she may be uncomfortable of me doing something with a girl too ???

I already went to see a lawyer for a divorce she doesn’t know yet about it ( in case to protect my back ) even if I still want to believe/ save our relationship because of our 2 little ones ( I just can’t conceive of living with someone which at the end is looking to have other connexion with other guy, )

I KNOW all guys (or 99.99999%) of guys masturbate to porn or anything that turns them on. I know this and of course, I know my boyfriend does this. It always has bothered me so I always told him not to tell me when he does or what he watches so I wouldn't get jealous. Today I don't know how we got into that topic and i said ""I bet if I named a porn star you would know who she was"" of course I was still joking, so I pulled out my phone and searched most popular porn stars, and I showed him pictures and the first few he didn't know, until I got to one and he started to laugh so obviously he knows who she was. I got so jealous and upset, I know I brought this upon myself but I still feel so uneasy.. he says he only loves me and only wants me and I know that I trust him. BUT ahh I hate knowing that he gets off to someone else I know its nothing and he has his needs but idk how to cope with this. I personally don't masturbate, mostly because of the way i was brought up and i was taught that that was wrong and disgusting its only a guy thing so my mentality is that way, but im trying my best to see it as normal because that's the way it is.

We exchanged ""I love you's"" pretty quickly, and he moved in with my family at around three months because he was living on someones couch and I wasn't having that. (My mom is really relaxed about it, so long as he pays rent.) We share everything; we rarely do things apart from each other. Laundry, cooking, gaming, sleeping.  And this is all fine, he treats me well, if we argue it's solved before bed, he's endlessly loyal and sweet. 

I just have this fear that I'm committing too early on in my life. I already have to make some big commitments with college and what kind of career I want. I have these times where I want to be alone, doing my own thing, kind of exploring the dating world. We talk about marriage in the future, and while I meant it, I just am getting more and more unsure. 

I just kind of assumed I just have ""grass is greener"" syndrome. It happens to everyone, but considering my young age... it's hard to tell. 

I don't want to lose him, though. He means a lot to me and he's been there with me through A LOT. 

I'm just really conflicted. Maybe I'm just bored because I don't have a job right now (job hunting is a pain in the ASSHOLE btw) and he's really all the social interaction I get in my day, though some mornings, I look forward to being alone all day while he's at work?

I'm pretty sure P1 is unaware of this, as she's afraid to hurt him.

The problem is they had planned a two month long road trip together before we were a thing. That's fine with me, but I have a few problems. 
1) P1 doesn't allow her to communicate with me when they're together. 
2) This causes her a lot of heartache and she tells me she deals with this by trying to forget about me.
3) I don't mind his presence (I knowingly came into an ""open"" relationship, after all), but he is intent on having me out of the picture.
These three things have me more than a bit upset and I feel are almost sure to destroy our relationship. He will have her alone in a car for two months to convince her to leave me, while she simultaneous tries to forget about me. Not a great situation. She's told me she has serious doubts about going, but feels obligated and also just wants to travel.

Ones he’s been interested in in the past and only talks to them when we’ve had a fight. He’s cut off contact now but yesterday I found out about someone else. 

He works in a warehouse. He occasionally goes over to the store where he flirts with a girl we’ll call Tara. Now. He’s barely mentioned her to me. He constantly complains about his coworkers, or tells me about interactions with the ones he’s friendly with. 

Yesterday when I went to pick him up we went to the store. When Tara walked down the stairs it was like a magnet drawing his eyes to her. He went into his flirty pose and said ‘hey Love’. He never calls anyone that not even me. And when he was talking to her he spoke in his soft voice. He didn’t do this with anyone else. 

Apparently it’s just a joke and how they interact. She does it right back. She stood in my opinion too close and then when I said who I was she seems so surprised. And actually took a step away from him. 

I don’t know how to feel. This was yesterday. We’ve had so many fights in the last week about him flirting with other woman and he does it right in Front of me and our son (7 months). 

When I first confronted him his response was ‘I don’t have her on social media or her number’ so he just actively flirts with her when they’re together and never told me about any of their interactions. 

I stayed at his mums last night and he offered to talk to her about what they do and put a stop to it. He even filmed it for me and is apparently sending it now. On the phone call after it he said that she seemed surprised and didn’t know they were flirting. 

I don’t know how to feel. I feel it’s worse if they were both just ‘so unaware and totally joking’ problem is he hid her from me and then fucked up in front of me. I don’t know what they’ve actually done or how far it’s gone. And it seems to be that he’s not taking me seriously when I said it was straight up freaking flirting

I've known this woman for a decade now. We've remained good friends since high school and even when we went to college two states away. 

Today she was back in town, as I am, for Mother's Day Weekend. We spent the entire day together at the beach catching up and went out to get a few drinks. We haven't seen each other in years, but it's as if we picked up right where we left off the last time we got together. Now, I've had a crush on her for a while and today only solidified this. In my \(not so humble\) opinion we have excellent chemistry. Share similar interests, the same sense of humor, same love for the same things in life \(no, we aren't the same person\). Our personalities mesh extremely well. 

Here's the problem: I want to ask her out badly. Unfortunately, she lives \(and is fairly well rooted in her career\) in the state where she went to college. Which is a nice 10\-hour drive away from where I currently live. Or a $200 plane ticket, depending on how you look at it. 

I've done long distance before \(10,000 miles apart for 6 months, if you can believe that\) and it completely doomed that relationship. Hence why I didn't bring it up to her yesterday, the prospect of another long distance relationship ending in that manner... isn't something I want to go through again. Honestly, I'm having a lot of difficulty discerning if our chemistry stems from the fact that we're just excellent friends, or if she has feelings for me likewise to my feelings for her. I also should mention that she became very happy and excited at the idea of me coming up to visit her for 4 or 5 days this summer, which I really can't wait to do. 

Long story short, should I just shoot my shot and risk creating a weird ""thing we never talk about"" between us? Or, should I \(for lack of a much less melodramatic phrase\) accept my fate and just move on. Obviously, we'd remain excellent friends and all of that wonderful stuff, but just kind of accept the fact that \- because of the distance \- dating her at any time in the near/distant future is probably highly unlikely?

During one of my shut down moments, he told me to answer him or he would ""punch me in the nose and kill me"". 

I have never heard him say anything like that before, he has punched holes and dents in our walls before, shoved me, but never anything like that. When I tried to tell him even though I didn't think he would ever kill me that it still scared me, he was furious. He started screaming and punching things telling me I was being insane if I thought he meant that and that I clearly thought very little of him if I let that affect me. 

Am I being crazy?

Help?,"So its almost summer break, which means school is almost done, which means i will not be able to see my girlfriend, seeing as how the only place we meet at is at school. My girlfriend tries to invite me places like the mall with her friends but i cant go because my mom is very protective. She will not let me go unless i go with A adult chaperone that she knows and trusts. My girlfriend refuses to go to the mall with a chaperone of any kind. So its like what the fuck am i supposed to do with my girlfriend? Im 15 now but my mom is too scared to even just drop me off at the mall. Shes set on the idea that where we live (Wisconsin) the most dangerous area in the world. And after seeing a video on facebook of cops beating up some kid leaving the mall for no reason there is no way in hell she'll ever let me step out the house on my own. I cant even go in my own backyard without her having to supervise me and whenever i try to talk to her about it it's always a hard no. She didn't even leave my now 28 year old sister on her own until she was 17. And like i said my girlfriend doesnt like chaperones so she wont let me go with her unless im by myself. So what am i supposed to do over the summer when the only way i can see my girlfriend is to go somewhere with her?

in the beginning things were amazing. he always cared about how i felt, put me first, did nice things. now I’m lucky if i get to see him anymore. he seems so uninterested, doesn’t help me when I’m feeling insecure, will even ignore me for hours if I’m bothering him. makes excuses that hes too busy for me, yet back then he would do anything to see me for an hour. i still love him but he acts so bland in the relationship and towards me now. although he has me feeling this way, I’m not sure what to do. there is no specific thing hes done that should result in a breakup, but if hes knowingly making me feel this way a majority of the time and does nothing about it, doesn’t that say something? i tell him all the time when something bothers me and he gets quiet and says idk what to tell you. it just feels like its at the end and when i confront him about it he also says I’m over exaggerating and that this is just how he is. i just want things to be better, it used to be the best relationship ever. 

i know leaving is so much easier said than done, but I’ve always given up on people and i really don’t want to do it this time. again, there is no specific thing hes done that i could say reasons for a breakup. no cheating, lying, etc. we have been through so much together.","['feel', 'like', 'boyfriend', '20', '1', '1/2', 'year', 'care', '23', 'f', 'firstly', 'thank', 'take', 'time', 'read', 'begin', 'thing', 'amazing', 'care', 'feel', 'nice', 'thing', 'lucky', 'anymore', 'uninterested', 'help', 'feel', 'insecure', 'ignore', 'hour', 'bother', 'make', 'excuse', 's', 'busy', 'hour', 'love', 'act', 'bland', 'relationship', 'feel', 'way', 'sure', 'specific', 'thing', 's', 'result', 'breakup', 's', 'knowingly', 'make', 'feel', 'way', 'majority', 'time', 'tell', 'time', 'bother', 'get', 'quiet', 'say', 'idk', 'tell', 'feel', 'like', 'end', 'confront', 'say', 'exaggerating', 'want', 'thing', 'well', 'good', 'relationship', 'know', 'leave', 'easy', 'say', 'give', 'people', 'want', 'time', 'specific', 'thing', 's', 'reason', 'breakup', 'cheating', 'lying', 'etc']"

(she's 22).","I'm 27, have fuckin terrible social anxiety. I absolutely well and truly love this girl at my work, I wont say her name. But I haven't really stopped thinking about her since day 1.
We went out last week, ended up at a club (not just us, she and I was with a mate) and she was taking my hand as we were going through the crowds,.. I held hers really tight. And we did it a fair few times. I know this sounds cringey and like, ""wtf man get a grip"", but it meant so much to me, queer as that sounds. When the night came to an end, we kissed for legit a split second, more of a ""goodbye"". I couldn't believe it though. I was pretty fucking happy lets just put it that way.
But anyway, we text back and forth a little. I ended up telling her how I feel, she said she was flattered but has a BF and nothing could happen. This was last week.
I text her again today, and told her I thought the night meant something to me. The holding hands, the fleeting kiss.
But she text me back saying she didn't even remember the kiss (it was more of a split second peck) and that thats just how she is, and that im reading into it all wayy too deep. she is genuinely a really friendly open girl. She's so fuckin nice. She said that ""I think you think I mean something more when I've been nothing but clear"".
So ive now took what she said at face value, and i apologised. I know she's taken anyway. 
But my question is like, I just want a second opinion on the situation. Am I being really naïve to accept what she text at face value? Or am I yet again overthinking this text message now?! 
I feel like such an idiot about it all to think that i've gave it all so much thought and it probably meant absolutely nothing to her.
Any thoughts are appreciated guys,.. im pretty down in the dumps about shit rn, i like her soo fuwkin much.

And while she was beautiful and I of course wanted a physically intimate relationship with her, what I fell for was her personality. I didn’t find her all that attractive until I started to like her, once told her (drunk and we were joking) that I’d never want to fuck her. It took years and what I fell for was her spirit and her personality more than anything. 

We haven’t talked in forever cause she became under the impression I was only her friend because I “was in love with her” and wasn’t even in love but that I just wanted to bang, or was like one of those guys that just *liked the idea of her*...you know the type.

I’ve read a lot of similar testimonials online from women who’ve said the same thing, like your friend was just a nice guy biding his time. That’s what makes me wonder.

Maybe that applies cause she was in a relationship, but I never made a move on her like that I just wanted to be a supportive friend. Then again, I wanted at some point in the future, provided that it happened genuinely, that way we could be together but that was a quiet fantasy and I lived my life as normal, not biding my time for her. 

We haven’t talked in forever cause I know I approach her it’ll be a big thing, especially because “if I really do love her” I’ll be happy to just leave her and let her do her thing right?

We just moved in together \(let’s say from State X to State Y\) last august and we moved to a new state so we could both start graduate school. Things have been a little bit rocky since we moved, but it’s generally just been us working out the kinks. Other than a few normal hiccups, we have been having a great time and, I thought, had been feeling super in love. When we both used to live apart in State X, we lived alone \(meaning without roommates\). I had a studio and he had a studio, we saw each other when we wanted to and we could have ample space when we desired. This was pretty great for us. We are both highly introverted and while we love each other’s company, need a lot of time to ourselves respectively. Since we moved to State Y, we moved into a 2bd apt so we could each have our own rooms. We sleep together most nights but sometimes take a night to ourselves. We wanted a way to cohabitate but to still keep our independence and also keep the spark going between us.  But to be honest, we definitely don't get as much time completely on our own respectively as we did in State X. I also do think, that in some ways we both miss State X, but that is probably neither here nor there. 

Anyway, we are each finishing up our first year of graduate school \(woo!\). For the past few weeks, though, my partner has been acting weird. Almost like he is a different person. Not as affectionate, way more time by himself. Not wanting to participate in our normal activities with me \(yoga, meditation, running, cooking meals together, etc etc\). He has been snapping at me at the first sign of something being off. I don’t understand. I wish I knew why.

Then last weekend we got in a huge fight. It was literally over nothing. The fight started over making soup for dinner and it escalated really quickly to the point where I left because his anger was scaring me \(he has never physically touched me, so nothing like that, just scary anger\). I walked around town for a few hours and eventually went over to a friend’s house and stayed long enough to feel like my partner had probably cooled down. 

I went back home hoping to talk about the whole thing and resolve it, and also hoping to get some insight into what had been going on with him. He was asleep. The next morning he was supposed to leave for a meditation retreat where he would be essentially unreachable for a week \(normally this kind of thing is fine with me but with unresolved conflict, it's tough\). He got up at 6:00am the next morning and I got up to try and talk with him quickly before he left. He was still angry and just yelled and then slammed the door while leaving. 

We still haven’t talked. He still isn’t back. I am supposed to go out of town now on Monday morning and I just want this to be resolved. I've been super anxious all week just wondering what is going on. He has messaged me a few times from his retreat. One time asking for solitude, which I honored. The next time was yesterday morning wishing me well and saying that he hoped that I was doing well with my papers and looking forward to my much deserved vacation. This seemed encouraging! I asked if he was going to be back in time for us to talk before I went out of town, and he hasn’t responded. 

WTF is going on?! I just wish I could get some insight into his mind. Plus this separation has been making me feel super anxious just because I am wondering whether he is thinking about breaking up with me or not. Which, if he does, I suppose I have to be fine with this but of course I would be devastated. I just wish I knew why he was suddenly acting like this! Has anyone experienced anything like this?? What should I do? Should I be worried?? 

TL;DR: Partner has been acting weird and distant; we got in a fight and then he left for a week. I am now going out of town on Monday and want to resolve things but don’t know when he is coming back exactly. What would you do in my situation?

At first she absolutely hated me. I really got on her nerves because of specific things I did. She was straight up with me and told me what I was doing to aggravate her. I just wanted to be her friend because she was a cool person. I had no interest in a relationship with her at the time. She got a boyfriend who was 19 and lived in a different state than her (so she is okay with long distance relationships). And after that I didn't really talk to her for about a month. Durring this time I was really working on changing the way I acted towards people. I had a problem with correcting people but after a while of working at it I eventually quit all that.
     About a month later she decided to play Ark survival evolved with me and a couple other people. This was the first time I talked to her in an Xbox party since the time she didn't like me at all. I had changed at this point, and she really noticed it. We had a great time joking around and just having fun. About a week later after we played quite a bit together with other people, the party's discussion went to the topic of ""your favorite people"". She stated that her boyfriend, her best friend, and me of all people were her favorite people. I was surprised that I was on the list. I was really happy that she now liked me as a friend because I always liked her as a friend.
     Fast forward a few weeks... She broke up with her boyfriend because he was a fake douche. At first he was really kind and won her heart, but after he won her, he quit trying to impress her, and didn't treat her like a princess. I felt bad for her and asked her how she was doing. Her best friend never asked if she was okay or even what happened between them. She was kind of hurt that her best friend didn't seem to care. I tried to cheer her up as much as I could. For about a whole week, I was pretty much the only person she talked to on Xbox. We played ark together, just her and I and had a lot of fun. We told some stories about ourselves and got to know each other better. This is when I started to like her...
     We played with other people too eventually and then it started to seem like she liked me as well, because whenever I would leave to eat dinner, or just to get off for the night, she would say, ""well I'm getting off too then"". And one time after I came back from dinner she said, ""I missed you while you were gone"". This to me seems pretty obvious that she liked me, but maybe I'm wrong. There were a few other things that she said that seemed like hints or whatever so I decided to tell her that I liked her over Snapchat texts. I think this might have been a mistake though... this is how the conversation turned out:

Me: I like you (a lot more wordy in actuality)

Her: I am very thankful for you telling me, I'm not ready to jump into anything this quick, I'm still licking the wounds from the last one

Me: I understand, I didn't expect you to be ready this soon. Maybe I should have waited to tell you. 

Her: No don't say that. It's my fault this time. I'm sorry, I really am. I hope things don't get awkward is all.

     Durring this time we had the Golden heart in Snapchat which meant we both texted each other the most out of all our friends which eventually turned into the red heart which is basically having the gold heart for 2 weeks. She continued to seem like she liked me. She left for a few days and I said I would miss her, and she said I could still text her though. Which seemed like she wanted me to text her. 
     Now I'm not so sure if she likes me anymore. She seems to be a but less nice to me and doesn't say the sweet things she did before. Also we no longer have the heart in Snapchat and she often times doesn't respond to my snaps. I don't know what happened, if maybe I did something or if she just lost interest in me, or if she never liked me that way. 
     I was thinking about asking her if I did something wrong. If she ever liked me and doesn't like me anymore. I really want to figure this out because I really like her and I would like to be more than just friends, but I don't know how she feels at this point. The only reason I told her I liked her is because I thought she liked me as well. But now it doesn't seem like it anymore and I can't think why that would change.

I'm not sure if its because guys are built in society to not connect emotionally with one another or something. But I feel a greater sense of emotional connection with girls. With girls I'm able to express my self and have them express themselves to me. As for the guys when I do open up I'm met with either silence or a dry response. I've been a two-year friend with one of my buddies and we went to Elitches 20 times in the summer. Yet I feel like there isn't a strong connection. The only thing I experience with the bros is fun fun fun every time. If it's not fun then no one is around. I'm going through rough times with fake people and feeling lonely. What makes me more envious and lonely is that when I'm having a rough time or someone to be around I don't. But my friend who's been friends with me for two years has his cousins that live next to him as a connection and always brings them along when I want to hang out. At that point, I honestly feel more lonely because I feel like I'm third wheeling.

How do I build a meaning full friendship with my bros? I told them I feel isolated and want to start building a deeper friendship but all I get in response is ""What do you mean?""....","['20', 'm', 'hard', 'building', 'meaningful', 'friendship', 'guy', 'help', 'hey', 'reddit', 'start', 'feel', 'lack', 'deep', 'friendship', 'friend', 'sure', 'guy', 'build', 'society', 'connect', 'emotionally', 'feel', 'great', 'sense', 'emotional', 'connection', 'girl', 'girl', 'able', 'express', 'self', 'express', 'guy', 'open', 'meet', 'silence', 'dry', 'response', 'year', 'friend', 'buddy', 'go', 'elitche', '20', 'time', 'summer', 'feel', 'like', 'strong', 'connection', 'thing', 'experience', 'bro', 'fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'time', 'fun', 'go', 'rough', 'time', 'fake', 'people', 'feel', 'lonely', 'make', 'envious', 'lonely', 'have', 'rough', 'time', 'friend', 'friend', 'year', 'cousin', 'live', 'connection', 'bring', 'want', 'hang', 'point', 'honestly', 'feel', 'lonely', 'feel', 'like', 'wheeling', 'build', 'mean', 'friendship', 'bro', 'tell', 'feel', 'isolated', 'want', 'start', 'build', 'deep', 'friendship', 'response', 'mean']"
906,8izyii,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8izyii/i_have_a_beautiful_son_with_an_amazing_women/,I have a beautiful son with an amazing women. However she has made it clear she doesn't want a family with me. How can I help myself to move on?,"Im not even sure if this is the right sub to post this to. If anyone has a better suggestion i will gladly take this down and post somewhere else.

So first off, im a 20 year old white male. I live in the US. (Not sure if that matters) I should also mention that me and my baby mother split up about 2 years ago. Our son is currently a few months over 2 years old. When we initially broke up, emotions were certainly flying high. But relations between us now are actually pretty cordial and respectful. She would argue we have a better relationship now then when we dated and I don't really disagree, except in some aspects, and in my personal opinion, I think we're doing a great job as co-parents. Many other people have said that to us as well. Words can't express how truly grateful I am for this. 

Phew. So here goes.
I started dating this girl in my 11 grade year. She was my first REAL girfriend and I fell absolutely head-over-heels for her. It feels so good to be wanted by someone and she dramatically boosted my confidence and self image, even to this day. Anyway we continued to date throughout the rest of highschool and after we graduated. Then that summer we found out she was pregnant. At first, naturally, we were terrified. Being the young, dumb 18 year old that I was, I had initially pushed for an abortion, but I told her that I would stand by her and support her with whatever decision she made. She couldn't abort him. And im so, so glad that she couldnt. I love my boy more than anything. He is the pride and joy of my life and his arrival kicked my lazy ass hard enough to get me moving in the right direction. 

I've suffered from depression/anxiety and low self esteem since I was about 14. Going into my 11 grade year however, i had gotten fed up with my emotions. Something had clicked inside me and I started making active and concious decisions to work harder in school and pay attention in my classes. It changed my attitude towards life in general and I started to feel actually happy, something that I truly believed I would have never been able to achieve for myself prior to to this change of heart. It was shortly after this I met a girl. We started dating and being with her, combined with a newfound attitude, I became the happiest I have ever been in my life. However after about a year I felt that my depression and self doubt were starting to resurface. I felt like I wasn't good enough and that she deserved better and I was too stupid to see how much it affected our relationship and even at certain times when I knew how much I was hurting her and i knew what i had to do to stop it, I just wouldn't do anything about it. We were able to work things out enough to keep going and i knew i still wanted to be with her. After highschool though and even during her pregnancy (18 year old boys are stupid as fuck) I started taking her for granted. Making her hang out with my friends when I know she didn't want to. Telling her I didn't know for sure if I still loved her. Just all around not treating her like I should have. I stopped treating her like a boyfriend should treat their girlfriend but even worse, I stopped treating her like the fucking AWESOME person she was and still is. Sure enough, she got fed up with it and when our son was about 4 months old, we got in a huge argument. Afterwards we didn't really talk much for a couple months outside of talking about our kid, and then later she told me she didn't want me back. 

Well it's been 2 years since then. Im not on child support (yet..). Although i do give her money every month (with evidence, don't worry) and as I said up top I think we get along quite well and for the most part we're able to put aside our bullshit (She can. Me...ehh not so much all the time) to make sure we're being the best parents we can be. We were talking the other day and I expressed to her that I still love her and I want nothing else but to be together with her and my son. I asked her if there was ever any times when she felt like she wanted to work things out. She said that a few times she thought about it but that it was fleeting and I always did something (or didn't do something) to prove to her it was pointless. She beleives that were really just not compatible but I disagree. I believe we actually ARE fairly compatible but I know it doesn't matter and I try not to convince myself of that anymore. Shes made it clear she doesn't love me and although she doesn't directly say It, I can tell she practically wants NOTHING to do with me. To top it off recently she's been talking with another guy and going on dates with him. When I found this out, my heart totally dropped. I had a panic attack at work. This was about 3 weeks ago but im still trying to deal with the anxiety from thinking about that. At this point, its so fucking hard to say, but i know that there's no hope of us having a proper family. 

And that's the hardest part. I could give a fuck less about the fact that she's seeing someone else, although I cant lie it fucking sucks knowing that. But what REALLY gets to me is just that I know Ill never be able to have a family with this women, which is what I truly want.

BUT I CANT CONTROL SOMEONE ELSE'S FEELINGS!!!

This sadness and regret is consuming me right now, more so than ever. Im sure this will pass and I wont feel so hopeless in the future but right now, I dont see a way out of this. I don't know what to do. It's not only holding back my own progress, it's affecting how I am around my son, which is what im in most afraid of. My father was a miserable, miserable man and I know that his depression affected me drastically as a kid. I want to have the complete opposite effect on my son. I want him to know how awesome life is and to never have to go through what I went through to find his happiness. 

So now im at this point where I just want to be the best me i can be and be the absolute BEST dad that I can be to my son. But I've tried so hard for over 2 years to feel better, and as of right now, it feels like I've made no progress. Im not really sure why and I guess this is my main question/dilema for you guys, but my feelings for her and my attachment to our ""family"" are keeping me down. I guess most people get motivated when they see something they don't like in their life. They work to change it. I have the terrible habit of just giving up. I cant get over the fact that I've lost what's most precious to me, forever. Im certainly not saying that I want to forget about them, not at all. I just want to be able to move on from her, in a healthy way, So that I can be around her and my son and not be incredible sad, AND so I dont carry all of this pain with me and push it onto my next relationship. She's obviously moved on so I don't know why it's taking me this long. I just want to feel better. I've heard from so many people that word's don't mean shit and that no matter what, she'll always want to work things out with me, simply because im the father of her child and Im not a piece of shit. I don't know if this is true or not but it gets on my nerves  whenever someone says that to me because it makes me think we might have a shot. And every time I think we have a shot, it gives me hope and keeps me from being able to move on. I need to let go of her.

Please. Any and all advice/tips or anecdotal experience will be IMMENSELY appreciated. I feel like I've typed a book lol To anyone and everyone who read this far thank you so much.

907,8izwbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8izwbk/gay_guy_straight_guy_relationship_is_this_the/,Gay Guy & Straight Guy Relationship: Is This The Real Deal?,"Three years ago, on a crazy night for me, I decided I was going to try to find a straight guy online to convince into trying some stuff with a guy for the first time. Surprisingly (?), it wasn’t too hard to do and so I found a very attractive, curious guy. We chatted for a while and he was very cool, though nervous. Finally, we made arrangements and despite all the warnings out there about it not being safe, I met him at his house. 

It was a quick thing, in the dark, but a fun experience for me and it turned out to be a good one for him. A few days passed and he randomly texted me saying he would like to do it again. We chatted some again and I realized he was a really cool, normal guy. I went back to his house and we had some fun again. 

As time passed, this began to evolve into a friendship as well, with me being surprised he was usually the first one to text me and see how my day was going and just try to get to know me. Finally, the day came where it was clear we had merged into a pretty good friendship, that also had a very sexual side. He is my best friend now.

As we became closer, we began meeting up for fun more often and really began exploring each other. I recognized that I was developing feelings that were pretty intense, but I wondered if they were mostly lust so I kept quiet about it. 

The next thing I knew, he was meeting my family and friends; just as my friend of course, and never did we discuss what else was going on behind closed doors openly with anyone. In time, I wasn’t able to keep my feelings to myself and I worked up the courage one night to tell him how I felt. He did not back down or shy away from me at all and nothing really changed. He acknowledged that something was happening but he wasn’t really sure anything would ever come of it. He didn’t think he could feel the same way about a guy. And so we continued in this fashion for a while and it was okay. Sometimes it’d be less frequent, but somehow we’d end up right back together. 

At one point about a year ago, things turned and instead of just a little fun, we went the whole way and both of us loved it. He couldn’t stop talking about how amazing it was, how it was the best sexual experience ever and how he had never had this kind of connection with anyone ever before. He opened up not long after and said he had feelings for me and wanted to be with me, but of course he had fears about this being a part of his life in front of his friends and family. He also maintained an attraction to women. We would spend almost the next year tiptoeing around the idea, talking about it, but not being sure what to do with it. 

Then, something happened and we began to move forward at a crazy fast speed. It was like everything spilled out of him and out of me all at once. He admitted he had fallen in love with me. He also said this was new to him still and he also didn’t believe he had ever been in love before. As though we weren’t inseparable enough, we became even more inseparable. 

We became “official” just a week ago. His guard has started to come down. He has told several people close to him, though he still struggles with telling some people. I respect and acknowledge the difficulty, as each of us are entitled to our own coming out story and it’s a journey to be made at our own pace. He only recently felt comfortable saying he was bi, though he states he doesn’t see how he could be with any guy other than me. 

Mutual friends who do not know have made comments about how we look at each other or light up when talking about the other. I believe they are hinting at seeing something that we weren’t aware was so outwardly noticeable. When he finds out about this, he genuinely loves every minute of it and says he is so happy to have found something so strong it’s noticed by others important to us. 

When we make plans to see each other and we first lock eyes I feel like all the air is sucked right out of my lungs and everything else in the room just stops and goes in slow motion with every ounce of my soul being consumed with focusing on this man who is everything to me. I miss him the minute we have to part ways for whatever reason and my chest and body start to ache...or maybe just feel empty, as if there is this void...this hole...that is opened when he is gone. He is so bashful about his emotions that when he lays them out it hits me like a ton of bricks. He’s the first man and possibly person who has never crossed me, never hurt me, and never done me any wrong. I know I am so undeniably in love with him, yet I am so terrified of being hurt by him. He has given no indication to make me think he ever would, and he never has yet. I am scared the pressure of this...of his own journey to being open...will cause him to fold and leave. Yet when he talks it’s always hinting at this being “for life”. We’ve weathered lots of storms in four years and his strength is overwhelmingly beautiful. He is a beaut of a person, a strong and loving man. He seems to have this invisible shield that deflects any of the potential BS we could run into and he’s made it clear he’s got us covered. He’s the protector and I love every minute of it, but I wonder if that is strong enough to make it likely...possible?...that we can weather the likely and known storms to come in the coming days, weeks, months and years. 

Despite all of our feelings, he is still not sure where things will go. He does not mean that we will end, but he basically means how open and our he will be and what to do with the side of him that is still attracted to women. He is still interested in them and though he is not seeking any out, he has said he feels very free and unlabeled. He’s hinted at what sounds like a polyamorous desire, though maintains if that ever happens anyone and everyone would know and respect me and what we have or he’s out of it with them. 

As a free spirit myself, I am very much about not letting love limit life. Rather, I believe it should expand it. However, these feelings I have for him are so strong I’m conflicted with my entire ideology of that. Keep in mind, we are not there yet and may never be. He’s aware it would be difficult to find and maintains that if it never happens, he’s okay with that. His focus is on us; he does not actively pursue anyone else currently as he says he can’t imagine being happy with anyone else right now and he wants all of his energy to be focused on me/us. 

So, Redditors, what do you think? Is this the real thing? Four years of fooling around and now falling in love, am I setting myself up for pain and turmoil?

He works in a kitchen evenings so typically gets done between 10-11 pm, occasionally later. He usually takes the bus and gets home by 10:30/11:30. There’s been one or two occasions where he’s gotten a ride home but there’s been no issues. 

Last night he got done at 12:10 am. He stayed at work waiting for someone else to be done until 1 am to get a ride home. She and a third person went to grab food, ate, dropped the third person off and then she dropped my BF off at his house at 2:30 in the morning. 

He claims nothing inappropriate happened. I have a really hard time believing this. He could have taken a Lyft home and been home by 12:30. He could have communicated his plans to me. He did none of that. I don’t even know how to begin to process this or if I should just walk away and be done with it.

So it's kind of a long story and all starts when I broke up with my ex [23m] of 2 and a half years. I realized I wasn't ready for the next steps and needed to walk away. I stayed single for about a month but then decided I wanted to try casually dating because I missed having a companion and honestly, sex. I went on Tinder and found this guy who seemed alright but not someone I would seriously care for. We hit it off well enough and started hanging out. After the first couple of times, I realized that he was actually really amazing and not at all what I had originally thought. He is funny, kind, smart, caring, and an all around great person. We have been seeing each other for about 2 months now but casually. The issue is we are both in college in our final year. The quarter ends in 3 weeks and after that we are going back to our hometowns for the summer. Then in Fall quarter, I am studying abroad in China and he is finishing his degree back at our college. After that, he doesn't know where he is going to be. He is a journalist and because the market is tough to get into, he is going to look for a job all over the country. He hopes to stay in our home state of Washington, but he just doesn't know what will happen. Because of all of this, when we started seeing each other 2 months ago, we decided it was best to only see each other casually. We said that if we do end up in the same area in January, we can give it a real shot. But that is very unlikely and honestly an unrealistic dream to hold on to. I was okay with this arrangement in the beginning because I honestly did not think I would like him that much. But I do. I care a lot. I honestly could see a future with him. I can see myself falling in love with him. I think I am already starting to. But it just seems like it will never happen and that holding on to this dream is just a huge mistake. I'm just, very confused. I don't even know if I can trust my feelings. I just fall so quickly for people. I also have a bad track record of picking the wrong people. But he is so different than anyone I have ever been with before. But I also don't know if the reason I want him so badly is because I feel like I can't have him. I am just very confused and I think I need help deciding if I should just let him go. Is it crazy to hold onto the idea that it might work?

The problem now is that every 2 weeks or so he decides to throw a bit of a tantrum and goes back to his mothers. After i gave birth I bleed for almost 3 months witch made having sex a bit of a no no (he said he was afraid to do anything Incase he did damage to me). Even now it’s rear we do anything as I’m exhausted from looking after baby (with no help from dad). He keeps telling me he is loosing interest as I’ve been preoccupied with the baby and he thinks my feelings about him have changed. I have tried to reassure him that I love him but every few weeks he throws these issues at me a leaves for 3-7 days. He has been gone now since Sunday and the more this happens the more I start to think maybe he is right about my feelings. I do love him very much but and yes I said BUT it does start to wear thin. Any advice on how I could approach him and try get things back on track would be great.

Or am i just a paranoid mess because my dad died recently? Please help.","I'm not sure what to do or how I'm feeling. My bf (M27) and me (F28) have been together just over 8 years. And I don't know weather we should be together any more.  

Sorry for a long story!!

I moved to a new area for a job a year ago with the idea that he would follow in a few months, I know he was struggling to bring himself to move as he  started to get settled and more settled once i moved. (He had friends, a job and a hobby)  I said he was under no pressure to follow as this was a new thing and we had a successful long distance relationship for a few years previously with no issues. But he moved eventually and had been unhappy ever since.

But he has not been like he was before at all. For most of our 8 years he's been amazing and my best friend but now he's super distant, hardly touches me or wants to have sex at all (once in 3 months) and just generally treats me like a roommate rather than a girlfriend.

This has left me super paranoid, and it got to the point where I checked his texts, which I know is very wrong and I have never done before and owned up to and apologised for. 
But what I saw with one other girl left me very upset as they we're very flirty and lots of xx's at the end ( which I know sounds silly and juvenile) but I don't get this level of affection on messages, if I get them at all. 

I asked him to stop talking to her in this way as it made me feel uncomfortable,but I'm fine with them being friends as he said there is nothing going on and I believed him but even since he's been very protective and secretive of his phone.  And his attitude eventually got so much that I confronted him about everything and he said he's unhappy and depressed being here in this town (he recently lost his job as he took to many ""sick"" days as he likes to go away most weekends for his hobby) but he was still messaging her in a way I would probably not feel comfortable with. 

He says he wants to change as he doesn't want to loose me and I know he is genuinely depressed and has anxiety which I've encourage him to seek professional help and want to be there as much as I can for him. But it's hard to not feel under appreciated or wanted or used when he seems to be looking elsewhere and taking everything out on me.

I have to mention I'm extra sensitive at the moment as my dad died a few months ago (he was my my only other family member and we were very close) 
He was great during the first month but then he went back to being like he was before with me but in a few months since it's crept back to how it is now and I don't think I'm strong enough at the moment to take care of him as well as myself while he continues to take me for granted. 

I really don't know weather to just say I'm done or see what happens over another month or what just need advice and reassurance as im feeling very low and unwanted.  I don't want to be selfish as I will help him with his depression if the needs me but I can't help feeling so shit. 

TLDR: bf not seeming interested anymore keeps messaging girl inappropriately even though I've asked him not to message her in this way, is depressed and taking everything out on me. My dad passed away recently so feeling very fragile and in need of support bbut not getting it or any attention from bf. Should I stay?

She didn't drink at all, and she was interested in talking.

Next day in award ceremony we talked again. When there was silence, I akwardly looked at her, and she smiled to me. (She smiled immidetly when I made akward eye contact.) Does it mean something? 

We are chatting in snap, but it's like once in a day.

There is possibility that I will met her tomorrow at competition, should I her number?

We have been together for 4 years and have a 2 year old son together. He openly admits that he talks to other girls. He claims it’s all innocent and that it’s only because I don’t show him enough love or attention. Now he’s right about that I don’t show him the kind of attention I use to but that is because of the hell he has put me through. 

So here’s a little background. Our relationship started out great we were truly best friends that fell in love. After I got pregnant things got a little rocky but we got through it. About 3 months after having our son I was on his phone and happened to come across a text from his ex girlfriend, turns out they were talking my entire pregnancy and had even hung out. My whole world shattered I really trusted him with my whole heart and felt betrayed but my love for him ruled out the hurt that I felt and we chose to move on from it. Fast forward to a few months later once again I found messages in his phone this time from several different girls trying to hang out with them and exchanging pics. I freaked out and kicked him out. I was the one providing a living for our family and I wasn’t going to let him sit in the home that I provided and be entertaining other girls.  We broke up for about a month and a half. We ended up getting back together and the break honestly did wonders for us. We were happy and really putting effort into fixing our relationship. Everything was great until a couple months later there’s a girl texting me saying she is pregnant with my boyfriends child. He admitted he had a few sexual interactions with this girl while we were broken up and that there was a good possibility it was his. That was it. That love I had for him left my body and it hurt like hell on its way out. I went into a deep depression that lasted several months after that. Any little bit of trust I had left for him was gone. 

So now here we are now we live together do things as a family but the deep love that was once there no longer exists. He always brings up how much he wish he wouldn’t have put me through everything he put me through because it changed me. But then he will openly admit that to this day he is talking to girls because he wants attention and that if I have him more attention he wouldn’t have to. But for me I feel like I cannot give him that love and attention until he is getting it from me and only me. I mean he truly broke my heart I refuse to let it happen again. 

So is this just a lost cause? I always try to give him the benefit of the doubt because he’s younger and still has lots of growing up to do but then i wonder if I’m wasting my time waiting for him to change and realize that I can’t give him that love again until he puts his all into fixing what he destroyed instead of seeking attention elsewhere.

We have had a very unconventional relationship. We started dating in the spring of my senior year of high school and I never expected it would last almost through the end of my freshman year in college. She is so incredible and it's hard to imagine finding another girl that would make me as happy and comfortable as she did. We broke up because the distance was too hard overcome. Well I'm back down for the summer now and it is unbearable being this close to her and not even be able to see her. We both still love each other so much and I can't help but think this summer will be a complete waste if I don't spend it with my favorite person. It's just difficult because once summer is over we will either have to part ways or try to make the long distance thing work again.

922,8iyxl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8iyxl9/ending_a_business_partnership_with_someone_who/,Ending a business “partnership” with someone who has PTSD and has barely contributed.,"Alright, this might get a little complicated as most relationships do, but I would appreciate some feedback and maybe ideas on ways to handle this situation.

The players: Me (25f), my husband L (31M), supposed to be business partner S (25f), and her mother B (52f)

I began a performance company in a very particular specialty (let’s say circus  performer for simplicity). S initially got me into it and gave me 2 casual lessons. After that I purchased the supplies/costuming needed to continue practicing and learning on my own. I ended up getting a business license, website set up, etc. (I go all out when I commit to things like this... no baby steps. All in or out). It has gone VERY well over the past year. I now take specialized commissions for the costumes (which I make myself start to finished, roughly 80 hours of work per item). I also sell a few other related items on Etsy (again, all my own original work). I say all of this to show that I have handled literally every single aspect of my company from social media/advertisements/client interaction/cold calls/products/sales/everything.
Now, when I decided to start this, I offered S the opportunity to be a partner and work together. She was excited and agreed to split work on the performance side evenly (this includes marketing, networking, setting up events, advertising, calling locations, client interaction, as well as performing at the events themselves).
Over the past year, she has done little to nothing. I don’t say that to be mean, she just hasn’t done anywhere near the agreed upon work. I have talked to her so many times, set up dates to work on things only to have her show up 3+ hours late, I have delegated simple production tasks to her since she was interested only to have her careless work be unusable and I had to redo it (this has cost me time and money on multiple occasions).
She is all talk. In conversation she makes it sounds like she does a lot. She tells me and anyone who will listen that she does our “marketing”... but when asked she can’t come up with any examples of marketing she has done. She also deflects when I try to talk with her about it and even turns things back on me (ie I really need your help with XYZ project, I am overwhelmed and can’t do all of it myself.  She responds with “well I think that’s something the owner should be doing”)

Her name is not on the business. She has not spent any money on it. She has assumed no risk or liability.

Now this sounds pretty simple right? 

Unfortunately she has had significant trauma in her life and had a service dog for PTSD related issues. Which makes ANY conversation with her an attack. My husband L has been a very active member of the business and has been caring and supportive to her in many ways. After several failed attempts to talk with her about a contract to set payment agreements and minimal expectations regarding her involvement, I asked L to help me meet with her since he is more business minded and would be able to communicate the details more clearly. She wanted a call first, so we called on speaker phone and explained the basics of the contract we were proposing, while making it clear that it was open to discussion/negotiation. She began to shut down and became upset and defensive. She then claimed that her dog was sick and she couldn’t have a meeting in person to talk. (I found out later that this was a lie).

After that her mom B called/texted me. She stated that since L was representing me that she would be representing S. (He wasn’t representing me... he was helping have a clear conversation. He is also footing most of the bill for this business venture so he should be part of the discussions).

B laid the guilt on thick. “This is my heart speaking to your heart...” and then accused me of essentially sending my husband after S to intimidate her into signing (not even close to reality...)
They are also claiming that her face, resume, and reputation make her a partner automatically and that she is the “face” of my company (she definitely is NOT). We each have about 10 years of similar performance training, so this was a tad insulting to me.

After that, S bailed on a big event we had the following morning. This left me scrambling until wee hours of the night to get new performers ready and finish up loose ends. Event went well thankfully.

Sorry this is a damn novel. There are so many examples of her just not helping or contributing. It’s ridiculous.

She had also begun working off an expensive costume that I make (roughly $3000 worth). She was supposed to help minimally along the way and then pay if off based on a percentage per performance. She had done maaaaybe $100 worth of work toward it. And I have shelled out nearly $800 for the supplies. At this point I want to cut her a $100 Check and say sorry I’m not making you anything. But I also know this whole thing is going to be a shit show. 

I have already completely removed her/her photos from FB, my website, etc.

Meeting with her (and her mom) Monday and honestly I think it’s just going to escalate things. 

For those who are sill reading... what the fuck do I do? Do I gather the few items she has contributed, cut her a check, and drop that shit off at her apartment? Do Me and L go to this meeting on Monday to tell them “Sorry we are severing ties... here’s your check. Bye”? Any other ideas? She gets seriously babied by everyone around her due to the PTSD issues and so anyone she talks to will pretty much assume I’m a monster for “kicking her out of the business”. 

I’m at a loss. Help. 

TL;DR: My supposed to be business partner has done nothing but take advantage. I no longer want to work with her. She has no actual claim to the business legally. She has PTSD and plays it so I cannot have any difficult conversations with her. Now her mom is involved.

Confused ?,"I’ve known this guy for over 10 years. He, my husband and I work in same office. My husband and the guy have been coworkers and friends for more than 12 years while I joined the office recently. Our families interact outside work as well. My husband was out on a work trip and I was feeling really stressed at work. I spoke to his friend just seeking his advice as he is in a senior position and about 10 years older than I am....and ended up bursting into tears in front of him. He comforted me with words but while doing this he rubbed my lower back.i was astonished but did not react much.  Then next day I was sitting next him trying to work on some presentation with him and he patted my thigh telling me I shouldn’t lose confidence...I am doing great. For past 2-3 days he kept helping me with work but while doing so he rubbed my back and patted my thigh again (when we were alone in his office). And lastly he even hugged me ( side hug) when he found us alone in an elevator. I am not sure if this was just his ways of comforting me or should I read more into this. He has never hugged or touched me before. Actually I’ve never even seen him hug or touch any woman not even his wife in public. Hence all his gestures were really astonishing for me and I didn’t know how to react. Now I don’t know if I should tell my husband (jeopardizing their friendship and work relationship) when he’s back in town or just ignore and wait n watch (giving him benefit of doubt)....if the guy does this again  then stop him or should I go and talk to him directly?

So I got her number and just texted her back and forth everyday for a few hours and there was a bit of flirting here and there bc i enjoyed her personality. I met up with her twice after class for like a few minutes and it's just casual small talk. Eventually she asks me if I want to go to lunch and I say yeah bc I just want to talk to her and see what she's really like 














I pay for her lunch because idk? And we sit and talk for about 2 hours and i wasn't really flirting I was just being really nice but also sarcastic and jokingly mean sometimes (how I talk to everyone I'm somewhat comfortable with) I go home and I can't really remember what we talked about bc it was a lot of different things but we did have some type of chemistry bc obvi you don't just sit and talk for 2 hours with someone you can't click with. I just couldn't tell if it was a friendship chemistry or relationship chemistry. I didn't even hug her after bc we had a joke about it earlier and she expressed she didn't like hugging. We had a few small awkward moments here and there but she led the conversation mostly
























I'm just really fucking unsure about everything part of me says yes part of me says no. I can tell she's a little different from me (vegan, no drugs, religious etc) idek if I'm attracted to her or not. She looks pretty good with makeup on and without it she looks different but not ugly.

But after a week she decided to end our relation , because of 2 reason : 
-first and main was her boyfriend 
- second was that she was about to leave in a week in other countrie for a few months .
I supported her decision and we stopped making out . 
But the fate had other plans for us , and I had an opportunity to go with her , and I went with her , we came there as friends , we was still not together . But we practically lived together and friendship didn't last for so long , and we started again to make out .
One day I saw her crying , she was speaking with her boyfriend . And she told me that she can't be on 2 fronts , and she can't leave her boyfriend , so we (or better to say she  ) decided to break up again , so we did .
  But as always not for so long , she couldn't resist to her feelings ( not that I might be hottest or best guy she ever met ) and we started again to make out ( yes yes this may become boring ) and for this time things got more and more serious .
 After some time of our relationship may be because of my lack of self confidence I could not feel that we will be together after all , and I told her this . 
 For her this words was very painful , because she really started to have feelings for me , ( I had feelings for her to if I didn't mentioned before , and very strong one ) and from this point things started to get more complicated , I really offended her with my words and we again   decided to stop everything.
 But literally one day lasted or break apart  ,  but this time things really started to get colder between us and and in a few days our relationship a kind of ended , 
You may be surprised ( not ) but later that night we again had sex , ( our last sex so far ) 
She didn't said that we are back together , after that sex we had only one kiss in almost one week ( no sex , because she is on her period , this is the official reason ) I literally can touch her everywhere , but when I try to kiss her she hugs me and things like this but doesn't kiss me , we didn't talked about this and about our situation are we still together or what is happening between us , but I feel very , very bad right now , she became very cold to me,  today she went to a coffee with a guy , nothing serious just a friendly coffee , but I feel like a peace of crap and I don't know what to do or what to feel . 
 I really fall in love with this girl , and she knows that , she still feels something for me ( at least I think so ) , I know that I may deserve all this because she has a boyfriend , and they are still together btw .

When do you know it’s time to give up on someone? I don’t know how I feel about still having feelings for you and getting no feedback ever. I know we broke up, but I’m trying to reach out to you cause you were my everything. You’re probably not thinking about me, or crying over me at night, or waiting for my texts like I am for you. 

People want me- but all I want is you. 

I feel like I’m becoming so destructive over not having you which drives me crazy cause it’s all my fault. I’m sorry. I want you back.

I've posted here twice now about how I was getting anxious and possessive in my relationship and how it was straining it. My gf and I had always been very serious about us but recently she was changing. I talked to her about it. Turns out, she doesn't think we should continue dating. It wasn't all my fault though. I guess her priorities in life just grew away from what I thought they were.

So I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I feel that one of the big things in my life is to make a happy couple/family with someone who I love unconditionally and she does the same. I think I'd always place my relationship first. That doesn't mean I'd give up on everything else and be walked over. But that my primary focus would always be supporting and loving my SO and investing in our relationship.

In some ways I feel that this comes from my sad family history and me trying to fix it by changing the kind of relationship/family I make. But that is who I feel I am right now.

Is this a stupid idea? Should I just not look for someone like this and date more casually in the future? If not, how do I make sure that whoever I'm dating shares my ideals before its too late and I'm too far in?

Any other comments are also welcome. Thanks.

I'm \[F/49\] in a 9 month relationship with \[M/49\]. We had a bit of a rocky start with moving in together a bit too soon and his ending drama with a former ex. Nothing too bad, but it was enough to cause stress and think we were moving too fast. After a lot of good, mature talks about what we both want, some quality time getting to know each other, we're in a good place. The problem? ME. I have a lot of insecurities over the issues that happened early on and they are holding ME back from enjoying the relationship. \(Issues included the ex who claimed they had sex in a weird ranting call to me \[I believe him when he says he didn't\] and a few lies about his going to a bar a few times to blow off steam and reduce stress during the rocky time\)

I've often read that the distrust or other negative emotions we feel are OUR problem and if the other person makes good on their promises and has made the changes promised \(he has\), followed up on the behaviors he said he'd work on \(he has\) and genuinely is a good match, then why the heck can't I let the past go and just enjoy things? I see a therapist regularly and they have not been able to help me put a finger on it. I really want to let it go and be happy. I've read a lot of posts here to try and understand things and oftentimes, I read that experiences in past relationships can cause this unnecessary anxiety and going over things too much rather than just enjoying things day by day. I've had some doozies, so that could be the root cause.

I would greatly appreciate advice on how to move on from others who have succeeded. Is it something simple enough as just shutting off the thoughts and doing something positive \(I have had suggestions to take a walk, enjoy a favorite book/show/craft etc\). I don't understand why I can't seem to do this and thank you for listening.

\[tl/dr\] Good relationship with a lot of potential being jeopardized by my inability to let the past be and looking for advice.","['overcome', 'insecurity', 'enjoy', 'good', 'relationship', 'rocky', 'start', 'hello', 'f/49', '9', 'month', 'relationship', 'm/49', 'bit', 'rocky', 'start', 'move', 'bit', 'soon', 'end', 'drama', 'ex', 'bad', 'cause', 'stress', 'think', 'move', 'fast', 'lot', 'good', 'mature', 'talk', 'want', 'quality', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'good', 'place', 'problem', 'lot', 'insecurity', 'issue', 'happen', 'early', 'hold', 'enjoy', 'relationship', 'issue', 'include', 'ex', 'claim', 'sex', 'weird', 'rant', 'believe', 'say', 'lie', 'go', 'bar', 'time', 'blow', 'steam', 'reduce', 'stress', 'rocky', 'time', 'read', 'distrust', 'negative', 'emotion', 'feel', 'problem', 'person', 'make', 'good', 'promise', 'change', 'promise', 'follow', 'behavior', 'say', 'work', 'genuinely', 'good', 'match', 'heck', 'let', 'past', 'enjoy', 'thing', 'therapist', 'regularly', 'able', 'help', 'finger', 'want', 'let', 'happy', 'read', 'lot', 'post', 'try', 'understand', 'thing', 'oftentime', 'read', 'experience', 'past', 'relationship', 'cause', 'unnecessary', 'anxiety', 'go', 'thing', 'enjoy', 'thing', 'day', 'day', 'doozie', 'root', 'cause', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'advice', 'succeed', 'simple', 'shut', 'thought', 'positive', 'suggestion', 'walk', 'enjoy', 'favorite', 'book', 'craft', 'etc', 'understand', 'thank', 'listen', 'tl', 'dr', 'good', 'relationship', 'lot', 'potential', 'jeopardize', 'inability', 'let', 'past', 'look', 'advice']"
931,8iy5f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8iy5f5/my_17f_boyfriend_19m_made_a_fake_instagram/,My (17F) boyfriend (19M) made a fake Instagram account to stalk his ex,"We’ve been together for over a year now. The first few months of our relationship he would tell me he’d always have feelings for his ex. He would say it was never romantic, but he would always emphasize these feelings were there because she was a part of his life. 

Fast forward 6 months and he told me that these feelings were completely gone, and he has no interest in her life anymore. 

This past month at a family event of mine he took out his phone to open Instagram and show me a funny picture he found, only to quickly turn his phone off as he opened the app. I saw he wasn’t on his regular account, and immediately questioned it and demanded to see the account. At first he hid his phone and wouldn’t look at me, telling me over and over again he didn’t want me to look.

For context we’re both very emotional people and feel things deeply when it involves each other and trust. Both of us hate to hurt one another.

When he finally gave in I opened the app to see it was an account he just made, he followed about 60 celebrities on it and one normal account, his ex girlfriend. He broke down at my families Christmas dinner and asked if we could leave to talk. 

He went off in the car about how he made it because the night before at his friends house one of them FaceTimed his ex and it made him emotional. He wanted to see what was going on in her life so he made the account to go through her pictures. I cried and told him I had to think about us and what I wanted to do in terms of being together anymore or not, I truly believed he would never get over her. 

What hurt the most was that he lied about being over her and not loving her anymore. I’m really insecure about their relationship because I know it ended because of emotional cheating on her end, and because I know when we started dating he was still romantically in love with her. This sparked these insecurities and doubts again in our relationship. Am I wrong to feel this way? Am I over reacting to this account?","['17_f', 'boyfriend', '19_m', 'fake', 'instagram', 'account', 'stalk', 'ex', 'year', 'month', 'relationship', 'tell', 'feeling', 'ex', 'romantic', 'emphasize', 'feeling', 'life', 'fast', 'forward', '6', 'month', 'tell', 'feeling', 'completely', 'go', 'interest', 'life', 'anymore', 'past', 'month', 'family', 'event', 'take', 'phone', 'open', 'instagram', 'funny', 'picture', 'find', 'quickly', 'turn', 'phone', 'open', 'app', 'see', 'regular', 'account', 'immediately', 'question', 'demand', 'account', 'hide', 'phone', 'look', 'tell', 'want', 'look', 'context', 'emotional', 'people', 'feel', 'thing', 'deeply', 'involve', 'trust', 'hate', 'hurt', 'finally', 'give', 'open', 'app', 'account', 'follow', '60', 'celebrity', 'normal', 'account', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'break', 'family', 'christmas', 'dinner', 'ask', 'leave', 'talk', 'go', 'car', 'night', 'friend', 'house', 'facetime', 'ex', 'emotional', 'want', 'go', 'life', 'account', 'picture', 'cry', 'tell', 'think', 'want', 'term', 'anymore', 'truly', 'believe', 'hurt', 'lie', 'love', 'anymore', 'insecure', 'relationship', 'know', 'end', 'emotional', 'cheating', 'end', 'know', 'start', 'date', 'romantically', 'love', 'spark', 'insecurity', 'doubt', 'relationship', 'wrong', 'feel', 'way', 'react', 'account']"
932,8ixsuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ixsuc/m24_struggling_to_move_on_from_an_ex/,[M/24] Struggling to move on from an ex.,"She split up with me back at the end of March, when we'd been together for almost 1.5 years. I'd been going through money problems and jobs kept falling through, so I had to move in with her and her room mates until I got my tax return. It was a 5 month period where I was depressed and frustrated that I had to depend on her for everything and not feel like I meant anything to her. She'd buy food and such, ,but emotionally she never gave me support through that. And I'll admit I didn't treat her like I should have, I didn't buy her flowers or clean as much as I could have, but I was working 6 days straight, 12+ hours, coming home exhausted dirty and bleeding, and all of my money went to bills. I didn't buy games or go to the movies or eat out. I gave 110% to fix the situation, but eventually it wasn't enough. 

Ironically, the day my return came in was the day she'd decided to end it. I'll admit it, I grovelled and begged and pleased for her to take me back. After all, it was finally to the point that I could start turning things around. We'd actually talked about it. But she didn't want to see my reasoning. We hadn't talked about how she'd felt. There was no indication, to me in my state, of her struggle with our situation. Her reason for ending things was because she didn't feel that I'd valued her or loved her enough and could see herself marrying someone like that, which floored me. And just the day before she had told me how much she loved me and couldn't wait for our future together. 

For about 2 weeks, I barely slept. I rarely ate, losing about 20 lbs. I'd wake up crying, and have random panic attacks throughout the day, so bad that I literally couldn't work. I struggled with alcohol and cigarettes. I struggled with self harm and suicide. I figured 'what does it matter, if the girl who professed such love for me sees me as nothing?' if it wasn't for my friends, I wouldn't be writing this. 

But, as I calmed down, I started looking back at the relationship. I saw the parts of her that I'd covered up or ignored, things that I wanted to not deal with because I loved her so much and wanted to make everything work out. Things like: her getting blitzed at the apartment every night, to the point that I couldn't even move her to the bed and had to sleep on the floor in the lr to make sure she didn't choke on her vomit. When we'd go out, shed get loud and dance in bars not meant for dancing. She'd always get me to spend time with her and her friends, even though she knew I didn't like most of them, but never spend time with mine. She always said my logic and way of thinking didn't make sense, even though, as our friends say, I'm pretty methodical and straightforward. She never accepted my advice on any issue she had in her life. And the worst thing was her need to be validated. Not by me. Specifically by others.

This gets it's own section, because its one of the biggest things here. She needed to be validated, but to a degree that borderlines on compuslive. If she was feeling self conscious, or even super sexy, she'd disappear into the bedroom for like 2 hours, doing hair and makeup and picking outfits. Then she'd take pictures, and post them on FB with stupid captions like ""looking for book and coffee shop recommendations!"". And 1 or 2 comments would be someone giving a title or coffee shop location, but most of them were just things like 'youre so hot/ you should model for me/ 😍'. All of this while I'm sitting on the couch wondering where she went and why it was taking so long for her to get back.  She never came to me. She never asked me how I felt about her. She never said she was feeling off. For 18 months, it was straight to FB and everyone else. I'd confronted her about it. It makes me, the guy who is supposed to help her through those times of self doubt, feel worthless and like shit and like I don't matter to her. (the same things she broke up with me over, fyi.) One time I kept texting her and telling her to send me progress pictures, to let me know how it's going. She sent one pic of an eye shadow she'd done. That was it. Another hour or so over silence, then later that night I see she got over 100 likes and a shit ton of thirsty comments. But it didn't matter. 

So, about a month after the split ,I asked to see her, so we could talk. She agrees, and comes over one night after work. I tell her that, even though I'd wanted to get back together this whole time, I've decided to let her go. No more fighting for her, no more begging, just no more. I laid out the things Id had issues with in our relationship, things id buried. Things I honestly believe she needs to look at and address, otherwise she won't be happy in the long run. She's never taken criticism well, and said she wouldn't have come over if she knew I would be shitting on her. True, I was in a place of pain and anger. But everything I said was truth. As I talked, it felt like a mountain was pulled off of me. But she stormed off. I don't know if anything I'd said had gotten through. Probably not. All I knew was that I had tried, and I would be the one changing. She didn't matter anymore. 

Or so I thought. 

She'd had a boyfriend long before me. He'd been emotionally and mentally manipulative. He'd controlled who she'd spent time with, who she texted, and even had a tracker on her phone. I believe that relationship had set up so many issues in her that, even if I was perfect, we wouldn't have worked out. 

But, a few days ago, I find out she's been talking to him again. Like, *talking* talking. Less than 2 months after our breakup. It kinda wrecked me. Apparently, the guy that had ruined her life was a better proposition than I was. I didnt know what to do with that info, so I did... Nothing. I didn't tell anyone I knew. But, as we have mutual friends, I find out she's been seeing at least 4 guys since we split up. 4. While I can barely get out of bed, she's going out to bars,hooking up with dudes, getting her ears pierced (after she'd dold me she never would), and generally going wild. 


Even though I'd tried to release everything I felt for her, tried to move on, tried to quit hurting, the fact that our time together meant so little that she can just go on the prowl so fast is killing me. I don't know how to move on. I thought I did. I have no fucking clue. 

I know this is more of a rant than a request for advice, but HOW do you move on? How can I leave her behind and focus on my future and not her present?  I'm at a loss.

A real scandal, in that this guy was married with kids at the time. 

Personally, I am refusing to get anywhere near my old acquaintance, as he became this guy's boyfriend, shortly after the arrest. This upsets my two friends greatly, who are trying to support him and his new business as a pop\-up clothing & accessories store. They keep asking that we just support him as we've all known each other for more than a decade.

934,8ixpty,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ixpty/im_30f_having_some_trust_issues_with_my_bf_25m/,I’m [30F] having some trust issues with my BF [25M]. Are these red flags?,"I’ve been dating my BF for almost a year now and things are generally pretty good and sometimes even “magical”. We have the same life priorities and values, and are on the same wavelength for almost everything.

Where I’m having trouble is his “ambiguous” relationship with his girl friends: one is an ex, another is a long-time friend/hooked up once, and a few more “platonic” girl friends.

With his ex, they’ve known each for years, dated for about a year, and have a brother/sister relationship ever since. Few months back, they went out to a dance club (I was out of town for work) and they grinded with each other. He called me that night, told me what happened, and explained that it was a part of their friendship and it was something they did regularly before we started dating. I told him it was not okay with me and he agreed he’d never do it again (even though he thinks it’s harmless).

With his ex and other girl friends, he tends to use cute (and what I deem romantic nicknames) with them: “B”, or “BB”. This happens pretty regularly via text. When I found out, I told him that it was a red flag and that it was inappropriate since I think those are nicknames that are normally used in a romantic way. He reassured me that he calls almost all his close girl friends that and that it didn’t mean anything. Still though, he promised me he would never do it again because it bothered me so much.

Fast forward a few months after that convo, I asked to look at his phone with him (he promises to be open with me and let’s me use/check his phone. I hate that I take him up on this offer because of the lack of trust I have at this point). I see that he still uses those romantic nicknames pretty regularly and that he broke his promise to me. I feel sick to my stomach at this point and I’m ready to break it off with him. It just doesn’t make any sense why I would stay with someone I don’t trust. It not fair to either of us. He recognizes his mistake and knows he “fucked up”, and promises me complete honest and transparency that he’ll let me know when he goes out with his girl friends, and offers up his phone to be looked at any time because he has nothing to hide. This nickname thing was a last straw for me, but since he recognized it and promised me, I was willing to give it one last try.

Just yesterday, I had a strange gut feelings so I asked to see his phone. He gives me his phone (a little unwillingly) and I see that he’s been meeting his girlfriends without telling me. I guess a good thing is that I don’t see any uses of nicknames. But knowing he has met them for coffee, lunch, etc without telling me starts to raise red flags. He told me he didn’t want me to worry about these harmless meetings and didn’t “want to spoil my mood”. I tell him that is backwards logic and is the very opposite he promised me.

Sorry for the essay, but I’m at a breaking point here. The culmination of all of these incidences become red flags that are hard to ignore. I want this to work, but I’m losing more and more trust in this guy. I don’t want to live in long-term suspicion and anxiety over these incidences for the rest of the relationship. It doesn’t seem fair to him or myself, it’s just not healthy. 

Anyone else have a similar experience? Is this an over-reaction? Should this relationship end?

TL;DR - Boyfriend has ambiguous relationships with girl friends. Has grinded with an ex while we were together, used nicknames like “b” and “bb” for them, and has met with them without telling me. I’m having a hard time trusting him.

My mother passed away when I was ten. For the ten years of time I had with her, she made sure to tell me frequently that I was a failed abortion and was the reason my father left. It put some huge dents in my self esteem. 

When she passed, my sisters and I were moved in with one of my aunts. She made it clear that she took us in because no one would take ME in, and that everyone else only wanted my sisters (my mother put in her will that we couldn't be separated). Any argument my aunt and I have circled that anyone else wouldnt have taken me and she only took me because my mother asked. 

I grew up through my teen years watching her and my sisters interact, going shopping and doing their hair and makeup together. Whenever I would stand near the fringes to try and be involved, I would get yelled at. It was a common occurrence for my aunt to come home and yell at me for being in the kitchen, breathing too loud, or in my room being antisocial. No matter where I was, my aunt found a reason to yell at me. 

My family was very church bound so I tried to find the emotional support I craved in the youth pastor. I wanted someone to talk to and tell me that I was good, and loved, and things of that nature. However, I didn't really fit in with the large social group of teens around the youth pastor. I fell to the outskirts, and whenever the youth pastor did anything personal (went out to eat with a few of the kids,  had a few of them over to play video games, etc) it was never with me. Even the counseling that was needed from a few suicidal ideations I had at the time were handed off to my family, whereas anyone else got to do one-on-one sessions. My family was very fundamental in the church though. 

So I went off to college, all loans in my name with no financial help from my family, and I don't talk to my aunt because the only things she wants to talk about is how I'm not smart enough for my school, or not social enough to make friends, or am not sending enough money. So I cut her off. And I'm proud of myself for that. But I have a very deep desire for a mother, and it doesn't go away no matter what type of therapy, exercise or eating habits I have (unlike a lot of my other mental issues.). I need help figuring out what to do with this issue. 

TLDR; I didn't have a supportive mother growing up, and now I can't get rid of the urge to have one.

938,8ixj4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ixj4w/whats_wrong_with_me_24m/,What's wrong with me? [24M],"Hi, so for the last few months I've been together with this girl I met online, she lives in another country so we've never met, but I love her. I'll explain below.

A little background;
I'm 24 and ever since I was young I've had problems with emotions. I don't know why, I remember really young me being very extroverted, laughing or otherwise just having fun, but something changed. I don't know what or when, but it did, and that takes me to who I am today. I would say I have serious problems with recognizing emotions, and even worse problems communicating them, I feel exhausted after all the communicating when I come home from work. I don't laugh in the company of others, not sure why, I tell people it's because someone said I had a weird laugh once when I was a kid, which happened, but I don't know if that's the cause. I have a lot of problems communicating personal things in general.

This is my first relationship, I've never been in one, or been close to being in one. I've gone on a couple of dates in real life, but they haven't ended up in anything. So I started browsing online dating sites, and eventually I met someone. Everything was great, the first few weeks were super intense and awesome and it kept being so. A while into it, I start feeling worse, the relationship is still good but everything else just starts feeling worse, I'm not as happy as I used to be, I'm getting more and more tired, more and more apathetic or unfeeling, loss of motivation. Of course this also affects the relationship because I don't want to do as much anymore, video chats make me feel anxious and long chats seem pointless. 
She's great all through this, but I start seeing all the little things I can't do, small compliments are super hard, can't get excited over stuff, I'm emotionally unavailable and I just feel so bad, I'm not good enough for her, kinda start to despise myself. But I can't bring myself to end it, because I don't want to, so I also feel selfish and like a shitty person. Eventually it got to the point where I had to admit that if we met, I don't know what I would feel - I've never been together with someone closely for a long period of time, not even family really, so what if there's a chance that I just feel happier alone? I don't know if that will happen, everything might be great, but there's a change that it might not be.

Anyway, I just don't know what to do. What's wrong with me? What should I do?","['wrong', '24_m', 'hi', 'month', 'girl', 'meet', 'online', 'live', 'country', 'meet', 'love', 'explain', 'little', 'background', '24', 'young', 'problem', 'emotion', 'know', 'remember', 'young', 'extroverted', 'laugh', 'have', 'fun', 'change', 'know', 'take', 'today', 'problem', 'recognize', 'emotion', 'bad', 'problem', 'communicate', 'feel', 'exhausted', 'communicating', 'come', 'home', 'work', 'laugh', 'company', 'sure', 'tell', 'people', 'say', 'weird', 'laugh', 'kid', 'happen', 'know', 'cause', 'lot', 'problem', 'communicate', 'personal', 'thing', 'general', 'relationship', 'close', 'go', 'couple', 'date', 'real', 'life', 'end', 'start', 'browse', 'online', 'date', 'site', 'eventually', 'meet', 'great', 'week', 'super', 'intense', 'awesome', 'keep', 'start', 'feel', 'bad', 'relationship', 'good', 'start', 'feel', 'bad', 'happy', 'get', 'tired', 'apathetic', 'unfeeling', 'loss', 'motivation', 'course', 'affect', 'relationship', 'want', 'anymore', 'video', 'chat', 'feel', 'anxious', 'long', 'chat', 'pointless', 'great', 'start', 'see', 'little', 'thing', 'small', 'compliment', 'super', 'hard', 'excited', 'stuff', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'feel', 'bad', 'good', 'kinda', 'start', 'despise', 'bring', 'end', 'want', 'feel', 'selfish', 'like', 'shitty', 'person', 'eventually', 'get', 'point', 'admit', 'meet', 'know', 'feel', 'closely', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'family', 'chance', 'feel', 'happier', 'know', 'happen', 'great', 'change', 'know', 'wrong']"

He also has said he would like to get married “someday”, but there’s no indication as to when he thinks he wants to take the jump. 

Marriage seems more like a technicality at this point since we’ve established we’re very serious about being together for the long haul...but I just can’t seem to get what’s stopping him from asking me. It seems petty, and pushing the issue with him isn’t worth it in our otherwise good natured relationship but it is something that bugs me. 

The closest indication he’s given me as to why he’s waiting is that a) his mom is the devil and neither of us want her around for the wedding/anything and b) both sets of our parents have been married and divorced multiple times so he doesn’t have a lot of faith in marriage overall. I feel like if he had a hard “no” stance on it, he would have told me a long time ago! 

Am I asking too much? I guess I just want a little insight to what would make a guy so hesitant to propose to a woman he’s been with for so long and wants to make babies with.

940,8ix9v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ix9v1/should_i_keep_fighting/,Should I keep fighting?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years. I didn’t get into university so took a job at a hospital for a year and met her there. I was 18 she was 23, I thought she was too old to be interested in me but I thought she was really cool and wanted to hangout with her and get to know her. After bumping into each other on a night out and then a few dates we decided to start seeing each other. However the plan was always for me to go back to university, so a month after we started dating our relationship became a long distant one.

We did pretty well with the long distance relationship, I was a 3.5 hour train ride away and we saw each other on average every 4 weeks and spoke to each other every day. Our relationship grew closer and closer especially over the summers when I would not be at university and we would both live at our parents houses but both have cars and only be 25 mins drive away. We would almost spend an entire 3 months together and it was wonderful.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I was home for a few weeks before exam season and we were spending lots of time together but she seemed a lot quieter than usual. The sex dried up and it was me having to make all the effort. I confronted her about it and she said it wasn’t just in my head she had been cold with me and her feelings were changing, but that she still wanted to be with me. I headed back to university but the talking dried up again. 

Then I found out she was seeing someone else. I had his name and the fact she was thinking of leaving me but no other information. I was supposed to be studying for exams but this hit me like a freight train and I couldn’t cope. I got on a train home and needed to find out what was going on. 

I met her when I came back but I didn’t let her know that I knew about the someone else. She said she needed time and space and we agreed to a break but said she would still chat to me everyday. I knew she didn’t want to break the bad news to me before my exams.

By this point however that knowledge was eating me alive and I confronted her with the knowledge and we met up to talk. She said it wasn’t serious with him, if we broke up she wouldn’t continue to see him because she needed time. I asked what she wanted to do about us and she said she didn’t want to see me anymore but didn’t give a reason and said that she didn’t think this was the end for us.

Now here I am sat, 2 days before my first exam wondering what the hell to do. I still love her and I honestly think we could work with some changes. (I want to swap universities and move into a flat with her so we can become a proper couple). However I don’t know if I should carry on this fight is she’s not going to. I just really want her to tell me why as I feel I can move in either direction till I know why she has done this.

Also this might be kind of long. 

These girls created a Snapchat group based solely on me, calling themselves my ""hoes"". Im more or less a normal teen guy, so i go along with it happily bc what guy doesn't want a bunch of girls giving him attention. So they send stuff a lot about me, like pics of me in school saying ""(nickname) spotted"". They also send a lot of flirty stuff. I got them food a couple times and they loved it, but it didn't seem like they were using me for that, im just a really giving guy. There's a couple of deals here.

The first is a girl who already reads my snaps first. Whenever i send in the group or just to her she reads very fast, and most of the time send a cute pic back, a lot of times with a kissy face, rarely any captions though. I'm not sure if she likes me or not, if i had to choose a girl ib the group I'd choose her though.

Another girl is someone im close with, but don't feel anything romantic or sexual for. She sends stuff the most, responds just as fast as the others, but we talk a lot more about things. 

A couple of other girls are ones I know, but im not sure how they feel about me, they seem interested but I'm not sure if they are just tricking me.

943,8iwyx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8iwyx0/i_f30_need_my_husband_m29_to_take_on_more/,"I (f,30) need my husband (m,29) to take on more responsibilities","I need to get past something right now, and I can't. I think I need to work it out in counseling, but I'm just hoping someone can give me a new view on the whole thing. 

My husband \(m,29\) and I \(f,30\) of 3 years \(together 13\) have a one\-year\-old son. We love being parents; we love being together. We both agree we've handled having a kid pretty well, and overall, not a lot of complaints.

I work full\-time during the day. He works part\-time in the evenings; previously, he worked part\-time during the day, but he basically quit \(he loves the evening job \-\- it's what he's passionate about\). I drop our son off at 6:45 a.m. and pick him up at 3:30. A lot of times, my husband is already gone or out the door. Sometimes he gets home at 7:30 \-\- sometimes 10:30 \-\- and there are times he is off work.  Most of the time, though, it's just me and the kid. It makes for a long day.

We're not great at keeping house. We're decent. We both agree that I do the majority of the housework. He does the outdoor stuff \(which just started up now that it's warm\). I also handle the finances, scheduling, shopping, and home inventory \(do we have toothpaste?\) He cooks and he's great it. I love it. 

...but now that he has an evening job \(and it's a dream job\) and he no longer works during the day, things have gotten very off\-balanced. I feel like I do so much even though I have less time. 

When I get home, he'll have picked up or taken out the trash or done some laundry or mowed the lawn \(notice I'm using OR\). I will say, he has started to deal with the baby more at night/early morning now that I'm done breastfeeding so that I can sleep, but that took awhile and a bit of a fight \(and I have to wake him to go do it; he doesn't wake up right away when the baby is crying\).

A while back I told my husband I was insanely jealous of the fact that he had essentially eight hours a day to himself. Yes, it's convenient when the baby gets sick or has an appointment and needs to stay home \(like twice a month\)...but financially, it's making less and less sense. And, really, if he was using the time to put the house in order, run errands, do the laundry, etc., then I would probably consider the money loss worth it. In the past, he's said that he wouldn't mind staying home with the baby \-\- and that would really save us money.

And...I'm slipping. I'm just not keeping up with the finances the way I used to. I'm so much more forgetful than I used to be. I keep screwing up the schedule. It's just a lot for one person. \(And my job is emotionally draining\).

We've talked about all this, but it just doesn't go well. I lose it. I am so done that I break down quickly. It's just all under the surface all the time, and even though I've expressed this multiple times, he doesn't hear me. I don't know if he doesn't believe I'm really that bad off because I hold it together so well during the week or if he doesn't want to hear me because he doesn't want to take on more responsibility or all of it or maybe I'm not being clear. But I've said it verbally and in writing multiple times. When I ask him when we can really talk about it, he doesn't want to give me a time, just says I need to ""figure it out."" 

For Mother's Day \(tomorrow\), I just wanted a day to myself so that I could regroup, get organized, take a nap, work on some creative projects I've neglected, etc. Last year on Mother's Day we were in the NICU...and no one even gave me a card \(I'm throwing that in there, I know that was a year ago, but it's coming up again because it's that time of year\).

Today, we got in a fight because he made breakfast and when it was time to eat, the table wasn't ready \(I was in the other room putting away laundry\). He got on my case for not anticipating the mealtime and clearing the table \(which is covered in the bills/mail I'm avoiding\). I told him if he had just said, ""Hey, food's ready, can you clear the table?"" that would've been better. 

But neither of us is particularly meek\-mannered. I gave it back to him and then some. Just half an hour before, he's telling me how much he appreciates me and everything I do \-\- but the state of the table, apparently, is worth wounding me for. Of course, from my perspective, I just can't erase from my brain the fact that he is home 8 hours a day, free to clean up as much as he wants. He throws back at me that the stuff on the table is ""not his stuff."" It is his stuff, because it's OUR mail/bills, but what he's saying is that it's my responsibility. ...and I've told him so many times that I need help, that I'm slipping, that it's becoming too much, things need to be evened out. Of course, he feels that I'm invalidating his perspective. I am because in the grand scheme of our lives, his perspective looks very petty to me.

I get it. He feels like he can't bring up his own critiques or frustrations because I'm  doing so much. But that's just it. If he did more, I would have less power. I don't want the power. I don't want to be doing the majority of the work. I'm trying to give it to him or have him take it \-\- whichever way he wants it. I don't care. I'm worried things are falling through the cracks, that I'm not getting it all done and something is going to slip by me. I need his help \-\- especially if we plan to start trying for a second kid this fall\(!\)

It's also not lost on me that he might be feeling not up to the task or insecure or disappointed in himself or needing to be back on his ADHD meds. Whatever it is, I just need a solution because we don't have time for all this. 

Yes, the fight got dramatic. We yelled, I cried and I feel like I'm going to off and on cry the rest of the day. Then tomorrow is Mother's Day. I think I need to go to counseling \-\- or we do \-\- just so we can sort this out not in front of our son \(though he literally fell asleep while this was happening\), but before I added one more thing to my schedule, I hoped that someone would be able to give me a new way to approach it because I'm aware that this is very typical marriage/couple stuff.

TL;DR : Wife does majority of providing and caregiving in the household, needs husband to take on some of the work \-\- whichever parts he wants \-\- in order to be more efficient time and money\-wise. He doesn't want to talk about it.  

UPDATE: He now has a full-time job, which is fantastic, but it was a long process that took like 3 months, meanwhile, he was home all day not doing a whole lot. He kind of fell off even being in charge of cooking...which got very unhealthy and made the housework split uneven.

But, with him working, I've gotten re-energized and offered to cook two meals a week. We're eating healthier, which he's always complained about. But tonight he got pissed off that I didn't hear him when he wanted me to get the baby started on the bedtime routine. And it was the same old hostility as if I'm just another stranger cutting him off on the highway. 

I was completely caught off-guard; I was reading (and he was too -- Reddit, actually) and we were somewhat going back and forth about today's politics and I guess I somehow missed when he asked me to get the baby started. I don't know how I missed it except the fact that I was reading. He took it like I was ignoring him, but we were engaged in some conversation so I know I wasn't. I'm really not sure how it happened so I apologized for the miscommunication, but he considered it ""arguing"", ""giving excuses"", ""not acting like an adult,"" and ""not a miscommunication"" etc. It's true that this has happened before (my not hearing), and in those other instances, I've told him that I will always respond if I hear him. (I am notoriously chatty -- if I don't respond it's because I legit didn't hear you/didnt realize it was me being addressed).

So I'm just looking at him like...WTH...what do you want from me? I made dinner Monday and Tuesday (and subsequent lunches -- and we had leftovers tonight so he has not pitched in yet), updated him on the finances, did the dishes, started the laundry, took the baby to park and walked the dog yesterday, gave the baby his bath, brought the trash back in, got up with the baby in the night since he started his job, and of course, I take the baby to and from daycare...and I'm being cussed at for ""making things uneven"" because I didn't stop reading long enough to get the baby in PJs in a more timely fashion? It's beginning to feel delusional, like he either does not remember what gets done by each of us from one day to the next or he just ""feels"" like he does a lot and that's evidence enough for him. And he doesn't want to hear me give my side. If I start to give my side, I'm being argumentative. 

I really want to know who he's yelling at because it isn't me. It feels, honestly, like something triggers him. Like there's something else that he's reacting to that I'm conveying. There's something about certain interactions he just loses his shit over and I'm sure I've played a part...but he has to be reacting to something bigger or else his the reaction seems too out of proportion.

I'm at a loss. And no, I have not convinced him to go to counseling -- even though we've gone in the past and he felt it was helpful back then...I don't know.","['f,30', 'need', 'husband', 'm,29', 'responsibility',

At the beginning of our relationship his ex who he was with for several years was texting his trying to get back with him even though she was with another man. She told him when he was ready she would drop that guy to be back with him. He ignored her.
We’ve had a very rocky relationship over the past year and recently I’ve found out he was having a rather close friendship with his ex. 
I was downloading an app to my phone and because google is linked for our calendars all of his personal texts popped up in my app. 
He has been texting with his ex at least every other day for like 6 months now. He’s talked to her about our relationship issues And has gone to meet her for lunch a few times all in secret! She is still with the same guy who she was with when she proposed they should get back together. She’s also pregnant. But, I believe they are emotionally cheating. 
I brought up to him how I feel and all he could say is I said they could be friends. Sure I believe people can be friends with their ex but to the point your texting daily, talking about your current gf with them and going on secretive lunch dates? That’s wrong. 
He says I am wrong. Am I wrong?

I'll call him Jason. He's clearly very shy - not insecure, he seems like one of those confident-yet-shy guys, who take a lot of time to open up and trust.

I'm not very shy and I'm considered attractive, I get a lot of male attention, usually I dated men who are ""higher league"" than Jason.

We've been talking, texting too. I initiate more. There was one flirty texting conversation. Whenever I text he replies quickly and with enthusiasm.

His friend recently told me specifically that Jason is shy and stressed the point that he's ""one of the best guys he knows"", which sound to me like Jason does like me? Otherwise why would his friend say this over and over?

 I texted him congratulations on a promotion, and he replied with ""thanks (my name)!!"" and a red heart emoji. 
So I'm constantly debating between understanding that I have to be the one leading this if I want this to happen, which I'm not used to, to being afraid that he will think I'm desperate if I do, because so far most of the effort comes from me.

My friends tell me to ask him out or at least facebook friend him. I don't really mind doing that and I don't think men should always be the ones to initiate, but since this is still the consensus and since I led basically everything so far, I'm concerned of appearing desperate (I'm really not though!). It's like I need more signals for him before I do that, but he might never give them unless I'll be more obvious.

The first half of our relationship was fantastic. We were living close to each other and we spent our entire summer together. For the second half of the year we've been together, it's been a long distance relationship and things had gotten a little rocky at times. It's not that we ever lost our connection, we were just at different points in our lives and at times the distance proved to be too much. About a month ago we broke up on pretty mutual terms because of this. Well here I am a month later and I can't believe we broke up. I have kind of forgotten what mindset I had back then that made me so sure breaking up was the right step. What makes this so much harder is that we are living close to each other again for the summer. Part of me wants so badly to get back with her but I know if I do, it'll just cause more pain for us when we go back to long distance again at the end of summer. It's just hard to accept that this is the end for us as both of us still have so much love for each other. College aged male btw... Any advice or similar stories are greatly appreciated.

Am I overreacting?","I have been dating this girl for 6 months, I thought everything was going fine. We text each other everyday when we wake up and when we go to sleep. 

Recently for the past month or so she began sleeping over more often, which is great. I then began to notice that she would always be on her phone right when she sleeps and right after she wakes up to text someone. 

Last night I was using her phone to yelp some places for this upcoming Sunday brunch (She told me to use her phone). Someone texted her while I was using it (She wasn't in the room). Normally I just dismiss the notification. But, the first few lines were (""remember I miss you, and I Love you!!"").  

Now I know that this looks bad but eventually my curiosity (jealousy) got the better of me. I fucking opened that text.... 

And I wish I didn't.....because as it turns out, this was the guy that she's texting every night and morning. I kept reading some more messages, shes been texting this guy every day with messages like ""Good morning Love!"", and ""Goodnight goofball, I miss you, and remember that I love you!""  

Now.....normally I wouldn't react to this because my first thought would have been, 'Maybe this is her really close male friend"". But, for some reason this really really bothered me. Mainly because she doesn't text me like this. 

Well I confronted her about who she was texting every morning and night. She just said her female roommate.

Now I know this is a big lie, so I asked her who that guy was. (Backstory: He was her friend all through college, and I've never asked about him. he's the guy in most of her pictures and profile pictures.)

I then straight up asked is he someone who I should be worried about. She said no, and that he was just a friend and that she never texts him. 

I'm at a loss to what I should do here. On one hand I've caught her in 2 lies right now, and if it wasn't a big deal then she wouldn't have lied. On another hand, I'm falling for this girl HARD, and don't want to loose her.

I will do my best not to make it a wall of text. This is about me [20M] and her [21F].

TL:DR:
I want ideas on how to be dominant with my gf in ways that don't require lasting a super long time.

^^^End ^^^of ^^^TL:DR

We have been ""dating"" for a while now, in the sense that we are monogamous and see each other every 5 months or so for a few weeks. When we are together we do all the normal SO stuff. While we are apart we hold it together with phone calls, texting, and SnapChatting (both ""normal"" and masturbatory/sexual versions of all three). She is arriving in 6 days for 2 weeks. 

Recently, sort of on a whim, I pulled up a list of 100 super sexual questions and started asking them during a phone call. It was a fantastic experience, and I feel like we learned a lot about each other... including the fact that she REALLY wants to be dominated in bed.

Sex so far has been crushingly vanilla, and probably super disappointing for her considering she wants to be dominated. I did shit like ask her ""what she wanted tonight"" instead of just fucking her. So yeah.

She was being super honest about her sensuality, so I took the opportunity to really figure out what she wanted. She was VERY receptive to the following stuff:

 - Surprising her in the shower and fucking her
 - Hitting it from behind so she can't see me, and alternating fucking her and slapping her ass
 - Anal
 - Tying her up (she wants to lose control) 
 - Sort of ANYTHING that has to do with me initiating in a dominant way
 - Being ordered around: ""Now get on the ground and stick your ass in the air so I can fuck you"" 
 - Pausing in the middle of sex, and being ordered to give me a blowjob 
 - She wants to cum from sex, not just being eaten out

She has also said stuff like:

- ""I am yours to use me however you want""
- ""I am YOUR treasure"" (after I told her she was A treasure).

I think by nature I am not a SUPER dominant guy: I like to think of myself as a switch. I am good-looking, but not in a buff or built way. We are the same height. She is physically stronger. However all of this ""I want to be dominated"" shit has gotten me really really turned on. The entire experience sounds hot as hell. I want to do these things for her... which might be a problem.  

My fear:  
I don't last super long in bed. I can't give you a time (I don't time myself lol), but its... pretty short. I am worried that she wants me to fuck here from behind until she cums, and instead I will cum, and be forced to eat her out, which... isn't really dominant. I need ideas on how to please her despite this. 

Current ideas:

- Eating her out, but constantly stopping before she cums and doing other stuff, like kissing down her legs etc etc. Maybe nothing at all. Just let her lay there as I touch myself.
- Teasing the living daylights out of her. Thigh kissing and that sort of thing. Refusing to fuck her until she looks me in the eye and begs me to. 
- If shes tied up: maybe fucking her with a banana or something (she doesn't have any toys). Something a little ""weird"" to mix up PIV (I can last longer if I take breaks)
- Asking her what she wants, and then doing the oppeset ""I want you to fuck me"" ""No. Get on your knees and give me a blowjob""

Is there anything else you could add to this list? Anything I should remove?

You see she would ignore all my messages until one day she randomly texted me to go to our sons appointment (fair enough) she then started to text me on a regular basis and being nice and funny all round. 

A week later she then asked me to proceed to hang out with our son. Things went well and she admitted to me how much our son looked happy with the 3 of us together and how much she missed spending time and being around me. Didn't think too much of it until she asked me to hang out again the very next day, with our son again,  same scenario. 

Yesterday she asked me if I wanted to hang out with her alone, we did. Our son was with his grandmother getting babysat until he had a febrile seizure (fever caused it) we then headed to the hospital. Son was A-OK. 

Before I left she asked me if I wanted to go sleep over at her place. I did, figured I'd sleep on the couch but she dragged me into her bed to sleep. We fell asleep together, son woke up at night, took care of him, went back to bed with her. This time I took my chance, I wrapped my arm around her and she didn't mind. 


Now it's the next morning and I'm super confused at what the fuck is going on.

She really struggles with body-image issues. She has tried to explain them to me before, I will do my best to paraphrase. She feels overweight and unattractive, sometimes much worse than others. She tells herself a really hard time for what she eats and for not exercising. She feels like no one at parties ever looks at her, and thinks that no one in the world except me is attracted to her. She talks a lot about not being ""conventionally attractive"". She has no motivation to change the way she looks (and just to be perfectly clear, I do not try/want to put any pressure on her to change), and has accepted that her image is a struggle she will always deal with.

I think she is beautiful. Yes, she has gained a little weight in college, but she carries it well. I would describe her as curvy but in no sense overweight. She knows how to dress well for her body type, and really enjoys doing light or medium makeup. Even when she has her makeup off, glasses on, and retainer in, I think she is beautiful. I tell her these things whenever I get the chance. She knows she is beautiful too, sometimes, in her moments of confidence.

I think her struggle with this has started to effect our sex life. Not sure how specific to get here, but it used to be quite healthy when we were together and good when we were apart and could only connect through the phone. Now we never connect sexually unless we are together, and it doesn't feel quite the same. She has said that she thinks I am much more attractive than her, maybe thinks that she doesn't deserve me. I don't want to place all the blame on her, that hardly seems fair.

She sometimes talks about how she knows the importance of loving yourself, but I worry that she loves me more than she loves herself.

The important question is this: how can I help her feel more attractive when I am not there to show her myself? I want her to be happy, more than anything else.

I should also mention that our relationship in general has been under some strain that we have been working through pretty well together. We are both highly stressed a lot of the time with academic work, and often have to prioritize our work over the relationship for a few days or maybe a week.

tl;dr My girlfriend struggles with body image and self confidence. I am looking for ways to better help her with these issues.","['20', 'm', 'want', 'help', 'distance', 'girlfriend', '19', 'f', 'feel', 'attractive', 'wanted', 'college', 'student', 'get', 'end', 'high', 'school', 'date', '3', 'year', 'see', 'month', 'end', 'distance', 'sight', 'struggle', 'body', 'image', 'issue', 'try', 'explain', 'good', 'paraphrase', 'feel', 'overweight', 'unattractive', 'bad', 'tell', 'hard', 'time', 'eat', 'exercise', 'feel', 'like', 'party', 'look', 'think', 'world', 'attract', 'talk', 'lot', 'conventionally', 'attractive', 'motivation', 'change', 'way', 'look', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'try', 'want', 'pressure', 'change', 'accept', 'image', 'struggle', 'deal', 'think', 'beautiful', 'yes', 'gain', 'little', 'weight', 'college', 'carry', 'describe', 'curvy', 'sense', 'overweight', 'know', 'dress', 'body', 'type', 'enjoy', 'light', 'medium', 'makeup', 'makeup', 'glass', 'retainer', 'think', 'beautiful', 'tell', 'thing', 'chance', 'know', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'confidence', 'think', 'struggle', 'start', 'effect', 'sex', 'life', 'sure', 'specific', 'healthy', 'good', 'apart', 'connect', 'phone', 'connect', 'sexually', 'feel', 'say', 'think', 'attractive', 'maybe', 'think', 'deserve', 'want', 'place', 'blame', 'hardly', 'fair', 'talk', 'know', 'importance', 'love', 'worry', 'love', 'love', 'important', 'question', 'help', 'feel', 'attractive', 'want', 'happy', 'mention', 'relationship', 'general', 'strain', 'work', 'pretty', 'highly', 'stress', 'lot', 'time', 'academic', 'work', 'prioritize', 'work', 'relationship', 'day', 'maybe', 'week', 'tl;dr', 'girlfriend', 'struggle', 'body', 'image', 'self', 'confidence', 'look', 'way', 'better', 'help', 'issue']"

I’m ( F 19) going hot and cold on my boyfriend( M 21),"I’ve known my current boyfriend for abt a year and we have been seriously dating for 6 months. We are perfect on paper. He is intelligent, kind, thoughtful, attractive and so attentive to my needs. We have been long distance this whole time and he drives over 6 hours to visit me once or twice a month and we FaceTime daily. The point I’m making is that he treats me like a princess and is the best man I’ve ever met.
Here is the problem...
- I flew to visit him twice and don’t feel connected to him when I’m there. I felt like I was going  to break up with him both times at the end. But when he visits me it’s usually great and I can’t wait for him to come back. 
- I don’t feel really connected to him sexually. I just don’t feel the sexual chemistry and im put off by his natural smell during sex ( pheremones maybe). This isn’t anything to do with hygiene he is rly clean. He tries so hard to please me and we have had good sex but I’m usually just ehhh abt it. I’ve tried to make it better but idk I can’t seem to rly get into it with him like I have with other sexual experiences in the past.
- on this note. I feel pressured to give him blow jobs sometimes and it just turns me off. I just feel an overall pressure and focus on sexual stuff. 
- sometimes I feel so close to him and sometimes something just doesn’t feel right like he’s mr. almost there.
- we also never have deep talks and that’s something I really crave. Like the ones at night. But he’s really intelligent and we discuss world events together and stuff and it’s great. 


Anyways i feel like shit for feeling this way. I have talked to him and he said we will work through it. I just feel so hot and cold abou him.

tl;dr Basically my life is ruined by a girl I barely know.

I just finished senior year in high school. All throughout high school I was very quiet and didn't talk to girls. I've never kissed a girl. I never was bothered (much) by it until recently now that I'm going to college.

My parents are wealthy and have a big house. My parents divorced this year and I've basically had this huge house to myself. This has only heightened my depression.

There is a girl I've always had a crush on in high school but never talked to her so didn't have much feelings for her.

Since last year I started throwing large parties at my parents' mansion in an attempt to get girls. Obviously I didn't get girls and only created a venue for others to. One of my best friends went to a separate house I have with my crush. This made me distraught. I started crying and left my own party. I know I'm pathetic, The Great Gatsby reminds me a lot of myself lol.

I moved on from this quickly since I didnt know her. However 2 months ago we were at a party together and she started talking to me and we began snapchatting.

Huge mistake. This fueled my feelings for her greatly. Since then, she's literally all I think about. I wake up, I think about her. All day I think about her. However, she is also in love with my other best friend. At parties, she always asks ""where's [my best friend]?"" and tells me to ""watch [my friend] and make sure he doesnt talk to any girls""

This makes me extremely depressed because she only cares about others and not me.

So she's basically made out with one and of my friends and is obsessed with my other. Again, my depression spiraled. I would snap her and when I saw she would leave me on Delivered (however her score would be changing) I would become extremely agitated and anxious. My time was spent constantly checking her score to make sure she wasnt ignoring me. Im psychotic, ik.

Even after snapping her for two months, she had a work Instagram that she followed everyone on. All my friends, all her friends, junior guys that were attractive. I didn't get the follow. Everyone I know did, not me. Seems petty but was a stab to the throat.

I decided recently to actually get to know her since its not fair for me to be upset at someone that I barely know who likes other people that. I asked her to hang out at my house where there are an assortment of activities (pool, movie theatre, lake, etc.) for us to do. I worked hard that day to make everything perfect. She almost bailed last minute due to last minute plans but she ""got out of them"". 

She came and it was the best 3 hours of my life. However, toward the end, when it was night and just her and I to relax, I could tell she felt rushed. She claimed she had to ""pickup her sister"". I'm not a fool. Pickup sister at 9:30? She then snapped me rather quickly at her house with an attractive junior guy claiming ""OMG he just showed up wtf??"" 

I cried again and decided to just stay alone in my room for the rest of summer. 

So thats where I am. Im fucked. Shes all I think about. Ive tried hard to stop snapping her, and I didnt at all yesterday. But I cant. Shes all on my mind. I have a fomo. I need to see what she is doing. Im fucked. She is perfect. The way she looks, even her name. I know I will never find someone like her but she doesnt like me and I hate myself for it. Seems like no girls do. They like everyone else except me. They only like my house.

Idek what to do anymore.

My husband of 5 years has always been the opposite, living a very lax life that he kinda just lucked into. I’ve never had a problem with it until we had a child. While I was pregnant I was diagnosed early on (week 27) with pre-eclampsia. He provided zero support to me and began to distance himself even more. He’s always been “nice” enough but with no stability in knowing who he really is. He’s generally on auto-pilot which seemingly enough makes him appear to be nice. Well at this point he tells me he won’t touch me anymore. The doctors tell him to help rub my legs/feet to get the fluid down but he refused. He told me he would not engage sexually with me and then it got to the point where he didn’t speak to me. He didn’t want to request time off to stay with me after the baby, he was too worried about his new job (same company, new position). I was put on bed rest at 34 weeks and had to be induced at midnight at 37 weeks. My body didn’t respond and I had to have an emergency c-section. About a week after I had the baby he went back to work and began to act as if I didn’t exist. I have no family around and he’s my main basis of support but I found myself sitting at home with a newborn not knowing what to do day in and day out. I would wait all day for him to come home so we could be a family and I could get some relief to only be treated as if I don’t exist. My son is now almost 11 months and it’s gotten worse by the day. My husband has fully lost himself - he no longer works out, eats, watches sports, anything. He just is in another world, I can cry, beg, plead to no avail and it doesn’t change anything. When he’s at work he can delve into his projects and appear that nothing is wrong- outside of the massive weight loss and looking aloof. He tells me that it would be easier to just divorce then for him to grow or work on things with me. I wake up at 5am, workout, get the baby ready, go to my job where I supervise 7 counties made of clinical staff, come home and take care of the baby, then work on my mba after he goes to sleep. All the while, my husband sits back in silence and watches me. If something needs done I will have to do it or it won’t get done. I’ll ask him to talk to me and he says I have nothing to say to you. I found the following article and it hit home: https://www.google.com/amp/s/marriagemissions.com/emotionally-distant-husband/amp/ 

He’s not interested in counseling, talking to me, reading, or actually separating. I guess I’m coming here to find a what do I do? I want him and I want a family. I never really had a family and all my life I wanted one more than anything. I love him, I want him to love me back (although he tells me he does). It’s truly driving me insane! I will ask him to please not ignore me and he responds, “I’m not ignoring you”. This is the constant of every day that I have and I am at my breaking point. It’s affecting my well being, raising my child, my career, and now it’s beginning to affect my physical health.  I am sick all the time, my heart rate stays so high, I’m getting alerts from my Apple Watch regarding my heart rate, and I’ve began smoking again to cope - I know this may sound like an easy situation - ditch him. But I truly can’t imagine my life without him. Am I the one with the issue in that case? I’m tired of this gaping hole in my heart and I want our lives back on track and I want my son to have greater opportunities than I did. I just don’t know what the next step is.

My friends and I had a quiet night watching tv and drinking a bit of beer
My bf texted me in the night and I texted him back shortly after and didn't get a response at all
I assumed he went to bed and didn't text him further as to not wake him
I did send him a few pics on snap too 

Well I wake up this morning thinking everything is okay and were on good terms
I send him a few messages saying I miss him and can't wait to see him today
Nothing
I wait about an hour and text him again saying I love him 
He responds but its different than normal and I ask what's wrong 

He pretty much goes off on me about how I didn't text or snap him all night
That I pushed him to the side for my friends. He used the word f*ggot too which I hate bc my friend is actually bi

I just don't understand what I did wrong I never get to see my friends 
This was the first time in a few months

Knowing this I tell my best friend, who about a year ago was interested in her, but had recently expressed interest in being fwb with her, because usually I don't date people my friends already have an interest in. He told me then that he already had someone else in mind for fwb and wasn't interested in her, so I thought to myself ""that's fine and chatted her up a bit"".


We've been talking and hanging out together for the past two weeks, and I was getting ready to either ask her on a proper date or express interest in dating her next week. Apart from this, I had also discussed me getting to know her with my best friend and my feeling towards her so he pretty clearly knew that I was interested in her. I knew there was an upcoming movie night with my friend and her, but I figured since he'd had my back and had previously expressed not being interested in a random encounter with her it'd be fine, plus we weren't exactly dating, so if she hooked up with someone else I'd be fine with it.


Yeah so turns out I get to be on the receiving end of a text with my ""best friend"" that he had sex with her. I mean he showed signs of remorse, and I acted pretty respectful, but honestly I was kinda livid. He already said he's hands down never doing a casual sex experience against, especially not with her, but as far as I'm concerned the damage in our friendship between me and him is done, and I don't want to know or even talk to him again. My problem lies in what to do about my crush, because I know she does like me from multiple sources of people, but at the same time I think all I'll be reminded of is this is the person that resulted in the relationship between me and a close friend being split. I'm not worried about her cheating etc, because I know she's not the type, I'm just honestly just mainly pissed off at my friend who had already known all of this, known that me and her were a rather decent click and decided to fuck it up. Personally, I have mixed feelings on this, I don't really want to date her because of this incident, but at the same time I do because I genuinely like her too.

This is my first semi-long relationship and I need help understanding the position this girl and I are in:

So some backstory. I met this girl on Tinder and chatted her up a bit. I'm currently doing second degree related to my first and she is doing my first. We actually go to different schools within the vicinity. I have a few more years left here, while she has her fall semester left. I will be here in the summer taking classes and she will be here working  her small gig.

First few weeks of the semester we hit off and she was sleeping at my place 3-4 times a week. The problem is that recently we've been seeing each other less and less. Recently, I havent see her for over a week because of finals (which is fair I understand the stress). 

The problem is, I'm having trouble understanding the position I'm in in relation to her...am I booty call? A fwb?

We laid the idea that work would always come over play and she is very busy tutoring and working another small weekend gig ontop of school. 


Things were going great. However, this past week has feel like a chore trying to get her to hang out with me. We hungout Thursday, she texted me Friday after her late shift to hangout but I was asleep so didn't see the text. Then Saturday she went out with her friends which I was fine with. This week she focused on her work and now today (Saturday, over a week later) she's going out again. I mentioned how my finals week is about to start and I'm going home after for a week, so I may not be able to hangout with her for a while. Is it selfish I wanted to hangout with her. 

I feel like I'm putting more effort into ""this."" I understand she's tired but it doesn't seem shes as enthusiastic anymore during our conversations in person or text as she was at the beginning of the semester.  I'll send her things like ""how your day cute stuff"", or if she asks about my day ""much better now that im talking to beautiful."" Just stuff to lighten the mood and I'll get texts back like ""alright"" or ""busy.""
I asked her the ""what are we"" since its been 3 months, over text and she asked me my thoughts. I took that as a lowkey ""I dont wanna talk about it right now"" and mentioned we can talk about it later. I later reneged because Im genuinely curious to know and texted I would like an answer. 

I think my issue, and the one I would like help with, is am I thinking to highly of this thing between me and her? Is it actually less than I think it is going on between us?

The things that leads me to believe we're more than just friends:
. Sex without a condom several times (she was adamant we use it the first few times.
. We hold hands, something I can't see fwb doing really. She'll grab my hand before breakfast at a diner or when were spooning and stuff
. She has her bottle of shampoo and toothbrush here.
. We've gone on a few dates to movies/nature walks. 
. We had a small disagreement and she cried over the phone, which I can't see in a fwb ever happening.

Things that are off-putting:
. She talks about guys shes slept with in the past occasionally.
. She mentions how when she goes out, she gets guys to buy her drinks and then leaves after she gets it (fishes them...idk?)
. We went from like 100+ texts a day to just 10 texts a week.
. She'll mention hanging out like at 10PM and come over 30 min later with no heads up before (am I booty call?)

Am I being strung along or overreacting about some stuff? Her lack of communication recently leads me to believe were just friends, but the actions make it seem more than that, I'm just having trouble reading what she wants (considering she wont tell me) and basing my expectations from there. Am I being strung along as someone that can be used for the summer and next semester before she graduates?","['22_m', 'trouble', 'read', 'girl', '22_f', 'understand', 'position', 'hey', 'semi', 'long', 'relationship', 'need', 'help', 'understand', 'position', 'girl', 'backstory', 'meet', 'girl', 'tinder', 'chat', 'bit', 'currently', 'second', 'degree', 'relate', 'actually', 'different', 'school', 'vicinity', 'year', 'leave', 'fall', 'semester', 'leave', 'summer', 'take', 'class', 'work', 'small', 'gig', 'week', 'semester', 'hit', 'sleep', 'place', '3', '4', 'time', 'week', 'problem', 'recently', 'see', 'recently', 'not', 'week', 'final', 'fair', 'understand', 'stress', 'problem', 'have', 'trouble', 'understand', 'position', 'relation', 'booty', 'fwb', 'lay', 'idea', 'work', 'come', 'play', 'busy', 'tutor', 'work', 'small', 'weekend', 'gig', 'ontop', 'school', 'thing', 'go', 'great', 'past', 'week', 'feel', 'like', 'chore', 'try', 'hang', 'hungout', 'thursday', 'texte', 'friday', 'late', 'shift', 'hangout', 'asleep', 'text', 'saturday', 'go', 'friend', 'fine', 'week', 'focus', 'work', 'today', 'saturday', 'week', 'later', 'go', 'mention', 'final', 'week', 'start', 'go', 'home', 'week', 'able', 'hangout', 'selfish', 'want', 'hangout', 'feel', 'like', 'put', 'effort', 'understand', 'tired', 's', 'enthusiastic', 'anymore', 'conversation', 'person', 'text', 'beginning', 'semester', 'send', 'thing', 'like', 'day', 'cute', 'stuff', 'ask', 'day', 'better', 'be', 'talk', 'beautiful', 'stuff', 'lighten', 'mood', 'text', 'like', 'alright', 'busy', 'ask', '3', 'month', 'text', 'ask', 'thought', 'take', 'lowkey', 'not', 'wanna', 'talk', 'right', 'mention', 'talk', 'later', 'later', 'renege', 'be', 'genuinely', 'curious', 'know', 'texte', 'like', 'answer', 'think', 'issue', 'like', 'help', 'think', 'highly', 'thing', 'actually', 'think', 'go', 'thing', 'lead', 'believe', 'friend', 'sex', 'condom', 'time', 'adamant', 'use', 'time', 'hold', 'hand', 'fwb', 'grab', 'hand', 'breakfast', 'diner', 'spoon', 'stuff', 'bottle', 'shampoo', 'toothbrush', 'go', 'date', 'movie', 'nature', 'walk', 'small', 'disagreement', 'cry', 'phone', 'fwb', 'happen', 'thing', 'put', 'talk', 'guy', 's', 'sleep', 'past', 'occasionally', 'mention', 'go', 'get', 'guy', 'buy', 'drink', 'leave', 'get', 'fish', 'idk', 'go', 'like', '100', 'text', 'day', '10', 'text', 'week', 'mention', 'hang', 'like', '10', 'p.m.', 'come', '30', 'min', 'later', 'head', 'booty', 'string', 'overreact', 'stuff', 'lack', 'communication', 'recently', 'lead', 'believe', 'friend', 'action', 'have', 'trouble', 'read', 'want', 'consider', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'base', 'expectation', 'string', 'summer', 'semester', 'graduate']"

She has 2 kids, and I had lived with her for some weeks/months previously and it went well. About 1.5 years into our relationship she leaves me, and she's not giving me a clear reason why. I get sad and emotional, and she's also sad and tells me that she still loves me. After just a few days she's apparently back with another guy who she had met just before she got with me, which makes me feel kind of replaced in a way. So I get mad at her and I get all pushy and ""mean"". I asked her why she would leave me for someone else when we had so much together and such. I said a few mean things like that I understood now why her ex was ignoring her, I also called her mentally sick.

She tells me to just stop talking about it completely, but as heartbroken and angry as I was, I wouldn't listen. I kept asking her why she would do this, I was being very needy and annoying. After some days of acting like that she blocks me everywhere, I type her back and I ask her to unblock me. She unblocks me and we're typing a bit, even though she's mad at me. I brought up our break up and she just blocks me again like that.

I tried to do some ""no contact"" and after 4 days I check Instagram and I see that she had randomly unblocked me. I do the mistake of following her and typing her, where as I get no response back. I put my Instagram on private, and I continued my no contact, it's been 3\-4 days since. I have definitely gotten myself together, I would absolutely not be needy or pushy anymore. I think we all know how it feels to lose someone you really love.

Some things I should note, is that she has purposely kept a few pictures of us together on both Instagram and Facebook, and so did I. She told me that she wants the pictures saved because ""what we had was real"". I told her that I had seen that she was friends again on Facebook with the guy who she had been with before we met, and she removed him from there. I don't even know if they're still talking, but I would guess that they are.

 I also mailed her once a week ago to tell her that I was putting her stuff away in a box for some time, because it only brought back memories and it hurt me. She actually felt bad about that, she told me that she still has my stuff laying around her house, and that she doesn't plan on throwing anything. I give her an explanation back that I won't throw away anything, that I will only put it away temporarily.

She obviously still cares about what we had to some degree. She's barely ever contacting me, and whenever I type her she's either ignoring me or being extremely cold with me. I still want her as a friend, or maybe even to get together again with time. I'm curious if there are anyone who has been in her situation who can give me some advice to what she's feeling.

My birthday party at my parents house is tonight. Last night, I wasn't feeling well so I wanted to sleep. My boyfriend didn't like that. We had a fight on the night of my birthday, too (May 10th), which ended in me wanting to sleep because I was just so emotionally exhausted trying to work it out. 
Anyway, everything was cool until I decided to rest early last night due to PMS symptoms. He came in, saying ""I thought you came over to hang out. Do you see how crappy this is for me? I thought we could have fun, have some laughs and maybe have sex to make up for our fight. If I had known the night was going this way, I would have never agreed to go to your party"".

 I tried before this to reason with him, talking in a calm voice and trying to be understanding yet asserting myself, but then took that the wrong way. He thought I was being apathetic. 

He came in and apologized for what he said about the sex statement, but then started defending himself like it was an ok thing to say. 
I asked why he makes a big deal out of every little thing, and why everything has to turn into a fight. I thought everything had calmed and settled down, but he always wants to start drama.

""IF YOU CAN'T STAND ME THEN BREAK UP WITH ME""

""Our relationship is crumbling""

""It's always about you""

""I never get what I want""

""Relationships are about having fun, that's the whole point""

When we first met I knew I had met the love of my life however the relationship became terrible over time due to various reasons and it became toxic. I had never met anyone like her before and I was devestated and wanted to try and fix it. However she didn't and broke it off. 

Around a month ago I finally accepted we were over and felt ready to move on so started dating. I met a new girl who is really sweet, cute and really likes me. I like her too and we have tickets for events a few months from now. Although im a little guarded and it is very early, we clicked and I felt happy. 

However my ex recently contacted me asking for another chance and Im genuinely torn. Ive never felt what I had with Kelly before but she really hurt me time after time towards the end of the relationship. Right now I know I don't trust her and it would be a slow process to repair our relationship. Although it's early for me and the other girl I was starting to like her and I enjoy hanging out with her.

I know I need to make a decision but Im not really sure where to start. Myself and my ex are both really hurt about things that happened in the relationship and she's deeply apologetic about her part. Were both also in a better position to have a healthy relationship now due to personal changes in both of our lives. However I can't just forget everything that happened.

How do we recover from this?,"Hello wonderful people of Reddit. I am gonna try to keep this as short and contextual as possible. 

Me and my girlfriend have been together about 2 years and recently we moved in together. 
We both love each other but unfortunately an accident happened about 5 months ago an where I unintentionally didn't take action leading to her going through emotional suffering related to a past trauma that she has.

We have been talking about this with each other quite a lot and she can't seem to let go past of it and seems like she has emotionally connected me to the trauma in the past (Which I was not part of.) 

This lead to that we don't have sex anymore and she can't rely on me even though she says that on logical level she should. She does love me and has shown that but this issue is tearing us apart the more days are passing by as she has to relive/get reminded of the trauma when being with me at times. 

We don't have the possibility to visit a therapist due to some legal reasons for now.

So what can we do to fix this issue that we are currently going through without having to break up or visit a therapist?

I'll cut the long story short - I've been in a secret relationship for 4 years with a guy that's 3 years older than myself. We met online, he's flown over to see me multiple times and I think it's about time I fly over to see him. Although, I cannot, because my dad nor the rest of my family know about him. I can't fly over without telling them about the relationship because they'll ask too many questions.

I don't have a good relationship with my dad, but it's getting to the point now where I just want to tell him, but I know he'll freak out about both the age gap and the fact that we met online.

Any advice on how to tell him?

 So I (24F) broke up with my boyfriend ""Alan"" (25) about 2 weeks ago.  We had only been dating for 8 months or so. Before we dated I had recently been left by my ex of 2 years. I told him straight off the bat that I didn't want anything serious.  He completely understood because he had also just gotten out of a long-term relationship . We agreed to be FWB and all was fine until a couple months later. I had begun to fall for him and hard. We decided to actually start dating since we both felt this way. However, I made sure he understood that I didn't want a ""long-term, we're gonna get a house together and be together for years and years"". Just like in the beginning he completely understood. The entire relationship was wonderful. He eventually told me he had fallen completely in love with me and I realized I couldn't offer that back to him. So after long thought I ended up breaking up with him. I realized I sincerely didn't want to be in a relationship. He completely understood when I broke up with him. When I asked why he wasn't upset he said he had come to terms with it already and has only been enjoying the time he had left with me. Since then we haven't spoke. Now I miss him so much. I've had very unhealthy relationships in the past, and this one with Alan seems to have been pretty healthy. So I don't know if I should miss him? Is it normal? Does it mean I made the wrong choice in breaking up? Do I talk to him about it? I don't know how to get over this.","['break', 'boyfriend', 'miss', 'like', 'crazy', 'sorry', 'length', 'mobile', 'sorry', 'format', 'correctly', '24_f', 'break', 'boyfriend', 'alan', '25', '2', 'week', 'ago', 'date', '8', 'month', 'date', 'recently', 'leave', 'ex', '2', 'year', 'tell', 'straight', 'bat', 'want', 'completely', 'understand', 'get', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'agree', 'fwb', 'fine', 'couple', 'month', 'later', 'begin', 'fall', 'hard', 'decide', 'actually', 'start', 'date', 'feel', 'way', 'sure', 'understand', 'want', 'long', 'term', 'go', 'to', 'house', 'year', 'year', 'like', 'beginning', 'completely', 'understand', 'entire', 'relationship', 'wonderful', 'eventually', 'tell', 'fall', 'completely', 'love', 'realize', 'offer', 'long', 'thought', 'end', 'break', 'realize', 'sincerely', 'want', 'relationship', 'completely', 'understand', 'break', 'ask', 'upset', 'say', 'come', 'term', 'enjoy', 'time', 'leave', 'speak', 'miss', 'unhealthy', 'relationship', 'past', 'alan', 'pretty', 'healthy', 'know', 'miss', 'normal', 'mean', 'wrong', 'choice', 'break', 'talk', 'know']"

969,8iv8xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8iv8xq/ive_taken_in_my_friends_teenage_son_to_protect/,I've taken in my friends teenage son to protect him from his stepdad. What now?,"Apologies for long story. About 2 years ago my friend ""Laura"" (42) met a man ""john"" (4?)who seemed to be absolutely lovely and all her dreams come true. She suffers severe mental health issues and has had abusive relationships in the past. This guy seemed different....until he moved in. She has 2 autistic kids 4 and 6, and a teenage son 16. I'm 38. 

The more I hear about the guy the less I like him. He won't let Laura have any contact with his exes despite his kids spending time with laura because they are all ""bitches"" who are spoiling his contact with his kids when in reality he moved away from his kids and withdrew child support to go and live with Laura. Now his exes are mad as hell and it's all been extremely disruptive to his kids. John just sulks about how hard it makes his life. He also quit a good job and now is living off lauras disability benefits in her home. He runs a ""business"" but its really just a hobby he spends all day in his workshop and makes no money.  He says he dosent want to bond with her kids and wont even watch them for an hour so she can catch a break. The house has to be immaculate at all times with 2 young autistic kids and a teenager living there. The teenager works for our family business as a weekend job and has proved himself to be pleasant, hardworking and valuable to the business

.
Recently the teenage boy has done some typical teenage stuff. Nothing major, his main ""crime"" is not keeping the house perfect, forgetting to take off his shoes, leaving a plate on the side etc. This weekend he got drunk on his birthday and was sick and didn't want to get up the next day. His mother lost the plot, she has recently self harmed and admitted suicidal thoughts to me but blamed it all on her son.

I could write an essay on the stepdad but if you have read ""why does he do that"" by Lundy B
ancroft he is the epitome of ""mr sensitive"" and ""Mr right"" and he has Laura so brainwashed she can't see
 the glaring red flags waving in her face. In her defence she is classed as a vulnerable person and is very naive and gullible.

After the boy got drunk the stepdad went into a rage compeltely out of proportion to what the boy has done (stepdad is a self defined ""recovering alcoholic"". He has been threatening violence to the boy recently and at that point I suggested to the boys mother that the boy come to stay with our family for the night. 
The stepdad raged for 3 days to the point that Laura felt the boy should stay away in case things ""got out of hand""

Current situation the boy is staying with us and dosent want to go home. Laura is very disapointigly blaming the boy for all the stress in the relationship with john when it's clearly caused by his own bad choices and he is using his moods to control the entire household. When he is there they are all on edge. I have suggested she get family mediation and seeks medical help for her own mental health primarily because I know that a mental health professional will immediately realise that John is abusive. I strongly suspect John has beaten at least one former partner but I don't have any proof just things he and Laura have said.  Her whole personality has changed she just parrots what John says. 

The boy is compeltely confused as he dosent understand what he is supposed to have done wrong. 
I'm not sure what the next step should be at my end. Should the school know? Should I wait a couple weeks and see if Laura sees johns true colours now the scapegoat is gone? I'm happy to have the boy here he is in fact a mature and pleasant kid not the problem child he's been made out as. any perspectives would be really welcome as I never intended to get so involved but the boy has a part time job working for our family business and the situation just sort of developed from that. He obviously feels safer and happier at our place but his mother is frantic and devastated and doesn't understand why her son thinks ""the love of her life"" is a psycho. She sees any criticism of her perfect man as an attack on her. 
TL:DR
friends son moved in to escape his stepdad. I agree the guy is abusive but mom doesn't see it. Now what?

So, ive been dating my GF for 7 months now, and ever since i started seeing her(not being even exclusive) her parents were always against the fact the shes meeting up with me for just coffee. After meeting up few more time (BTW we have same social circle so we meetup alot, either alone or with our friends), we became exclusive. And let me tell you, her parents were not even a little happy for her, they were always trying to find the bad stuff about me, and they're pretty racist (im asian and my gf is white) - they would say to her, why would you date an asian guy, hes not from this neighborhood ( their neighborhood was so called rich), hes 22 and doesnt even have a licence that he comes over with a bike etc etc you get the point.
Thats not the worst part... my GF, even though she doesnt agree with them, she always try to be their good girl and just shut up everytime they ""diss me"". 

About a month ago, we had a break for a week, we fought about something else), she told about it to her parents, but after a week we came back together, BUT she told them that we split up completely, just to applease them. And one night, we met up, so she lied that shes meeting up with our group, including me in it, and her mom, on her way out, told her - ""please dont come back and tell me your back together with him"". It broke my heart. I never really cared if they liked me or not the whole time i dated her. But when she said that it really hurt, and in response, my GF said to her that she doesnt need to worry that we will be back together. That even made it worse for me... That shes trying to please them. Shes that type of daughter with her parents. She's afraid to tell then the truth that were back together, cuase shes afraid of the whats gonna come again, all the comments about me, ""why cant you find another man""... She really do hate to hear it, all the faces the make to her everytime she tells them that shes going out for dinner or anything with just me.

What should I\We do? We really do love eachother.
But now that her parents think that were not even together, we can barely meet up, cause its hard for her to lie to her parents to a certain level.
Please give advice on what we should do. Do we keep it a secret? Do we need to let go and breakup? Please help!

We've had unprotected and protected sex together. Over the last couple months our sex life has been kinda non existent and maybe have sex once a month. It's getting better though but if sex is rare wouldn't we both want to enjoy it as much as possible?

My GF is on birth control and my ""pull out game"" is strong. My girlfriend is just crazy anxious about not wearing condoms and while sometimes she'll let it slide, it's pretty rare and I totally understand and respect why and am in no way forcing her to have unprotected sex...its just sex with a condom is more of a workout for me. I'd rather go to the gym and do some squats because I'll at least gain something from that workout. And she refuses to touch my dick after I've used a condom but it doesn't matter because she doesn't get me off orally ever anyway.i just know I'm going to start turning down sex once it's completely 100% condom usage everytime which I know she wants that but it's just not worth it for me.

Her kids 19/14/8 were all awesome when we first met and I have tried really hard to foster the ""friend"" type of relationship with them(none of the real father's really give a shit) I work a little bit of over time about 55/60 hours in total a week. About 3 hours a night from home and have always done this as I enjoy the extra money.

She also does not allow me to control who is in the house when I'm not home (step daughters boyfriend is abusive, I have removed him twice from the house forcefully) and if I say anything about it I get shut down and ignored for 24 hours or so. 

When I try and bring up these issues she tells me Its none of my business, recently I asked her who she was texting as she was smiling and laughing at her phone, she also told me it was none of my business. 

I also pay a large part of the rent/utility bills and feel if I left she would be fucked and have it all come falling down on top of her, so i have held back in pushing the ""I'm leaving unless we solve this shit"" type of argument as I know she is insecure financially.

So as the title states, my gf of about 5 months just started taking an SSRI, which she has taken in the past before we started dating. Nothing has happened yet, since she just started today, but my worry is with the side effects. While, of course, the drop in libido that some experience would be a bummer, I'm more stressed about the ""emotional blunting"" that many describe. It's my understanding that feelings of emotional connectedness can be reduced, and the drop in dopamine can make you feel less interested in your partner in general.

Here's my question: do any of you know if there's a way to minimize the effect I'm describing? And do any of you have experience with this in your own relationships? I wouldn't ever want to ask her to stop taking it, but if it were making a noticeable difference at some point would it be worth bringing it up?

I never really had the courage to ask her out, because I think she's out of my league. A couple of weeks ago I went to a school dance and met another girl. She was cool and we hit it off, I gave a relationship some idle thought but I never went too deep into it. The next day a buddy of mine says she's into me, and me (being the hormone filled teenager I am) without thinking asks her out. The date was last week, and it went pretty well. Afterwards we agreed to go out to a theme park this weekend. 

That's all well and good, but I can't stop thinking about the other girl. This whole week has just been confusion central. When I hear her name my heart jumps, when I see a notification on Snapchat from her I freeze, when she walks by me I get butterflies, but when I'm near this other girl (the one I went on a date with) I don't feel anything. 

TL;DR I have a crush on girl 1 but I'm not sure she's into me, and I have a date with girl 2 who I know is into me but I don't feel that strongly about her

We sort of just know each other for about a week when we started dating. He's been a great guy, started to introduce me to some of his family and they sort of know me in a bit. Even if we are in a long distance relationship, we get to be happy this past few weeks when he suddenly messaged me yesterday how he wanted some space.

He was depressed like a week before that. He told me he misses his old place and wish that he wasn't stuck in the place where they live now. He's been dealing with it and some other issues like finance, time management for his school works and chores that has been delayed a lot. 

He has also introduced me to some of his friends. And me and my SO play a lot (mostly only about card games). They invited me to their group and talk there a lot. 

He told me that he still loves me, he just needs time to fix everything up in his life. That if i ever still have feelings for him, he'd be willing to pick it all back up. I don't really know what to do, the day after he told me this, we just played/talked like normal. It hurts a bit that, its like nothing just happened, like our relationship didn't happen. I don't know what to do and I still love the guy.

First post on Reddit so here it goes...forgive me for my noobness.
So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years (I'm 23, he's 27). Looking back, I've always been untrusting of him for some reason..most likely from my own poor self-esteem/disbelief that someone could love me and stick around for the long haul. He also has an addiction to porn that he revealed to me when we first started dating. It always bothered me, and I would continually pester him to get help. Two years ago, I started snooping through his phone (yeah, I suck). And I found that he had messaged this girl, telling her she's pretty, asking her for sexual details about herself and her history, (for a day or two, nothing long term). I found these messages and was super upset, rightfully so. I told him he wasn't mature enough to be in a relationship. He felt terrible. A month passed and we talked a bit and made up and got back together, on the condition that he would get help. He started going to therapy and has been consistently going ever since. He's doing great, but I, on the other hand, am struggling, on many accounts: my trust issues were exacerbated, i still find myself wanting to snoop through his phone, and we've had many fights about this. I get upset when I saw the other day that he had a short DM with a girl on Instagram, that he admitted to liking a few years ago. Their short convo was harmless, but he was using emojis and being witty and clever which threw me into a bout of worry that he likes her again. He denies it when I told him how I was feeling. He says that I can trust him and I have no reason to worry. It just seems like now if he ever interacts with a woman I just get trapped in this flood of anxiety and I wind up creating scenarios that aren't actually there. I distance myself from him and put my guard up for awhile before we finally talk things through and are then stable for a little while, before my anxiety takes over again.

 He is upset with me because he feels like I haven't truly forgiven him and I'm being paranoid, and I'm upset because I feel crazy and obsessive though I'm actually a pretty independent gal. I don't know what to do, how to get over these trust issues and my fears, and be confident in us. Is it possible? Am I crazy? Is this my anxiety talking or do I have reason to fear?

Some background: my bf is an absolute dream. We met when we were 16 and dated through high school with a few breaks due to making sure we weren’t getting too serious too young. He is gorgeous, smart, hardworking, gentle, supportive of me, romantic, sexy, loyal, and hilarious, truly the complete package, and obviously my very best friend. 

We live in an area/state that is STRONGLY influenced by a certain religion (that we were both raised in) that encourages getting married young and FAST. Literally 100% of my girlfriends are married, despite being 18-21. Being raised around this I always assumed and hoped my life would play out similarly. 

Sometime last year, when all my friends were getting engaged, I initiated a few “where is our relationship going” talks and we decided that we would get engaged later this year. I tried to avoid talking about it too much because he really wanted the proposal to be a surprise, but we started moving forward with our lives moving toward that goal. 

About a month ago we had a hard conversation where my bf told me he’s not ready to get married. His reasoning was all very comforting, such as he wants to be able to provide more for me financially and such, but I was shocked how crushed I felt. I had initiated most of our “marriage” related conversations and really put myself out there, so regardless of reasoning it almost felt like a broken engagement/rejected proposal. I definitely see his reasoning and mentally agree, but because I was raised to expect the first 5 years of marriage to be tiny-apartment-living-off-love-still-in-school years, its hard to not feel emotionally rejected. 

I definitely still want to move the relationship forward and we’re talking about moving in together, but that isn’t what I want and would result in literally being disowned by my super religious parents, including being totally financially cut off (which I could survive but it would make the whole thing harder). My concern is that if we do things HIS way I’ll resent him,  because I can feel it headed that way. I love him more than anything and we’re amazing together and I have no doubt that we’ll end up together if we want to, but it’s frustrating to think that we’ll be taking on all the adult responsibilities in a super difficult way for me if we shack up just because that’s less scary for him. I’m also deeply aware that my desire to be married SO young is partially the product of my upbringing, but I still want to start our lives together sooner rather than later.  It’s truly not about the wedding or the romance of it, I’ve just found my person and I want to start our life together. 

So: how do I keep this feeling or rejection and hurt from turning into resentment? How could I move in with him without feeling resentful of the chaos it’ll cause with my family? 

TLDR: boyfriend backed out of tentative marriage plans for the time being and it hurts more than I expected it to, and moving forward with our relationship in a different way would be extremely logistically hard for me. How do I keep this from poisoning our relationship?

He’s told her that he has a crush on someone else in his class, and that they both wouldn’t date each other. However it’s hard to believe when shit like this is going on.
So this is the second post in a continuation of me thinking he’s flirting.
TLDR of previous post:
Her: “*insert something here* is pretty cute”
Him: “You know what else is cute?”
Her: “What?”
Him: “You, silly ❤️”
I, after talking with some of you, deemed that that was flirting and asked him to stop. He said he would.
Skip to today and as I was glancing over to her texting him I saw 3 good morning texts, one was long and the other two were a bit short but still 2 lines big. The long paragraph said something really close to: “Good morning to the cutest little girl in the whole world. I’m going to be bored all day so shoot me a message if you want to talk.”
Not only that she will actively ignore me to talk to him. I got her phone for a little bit and after checking random timestamps she’s texting him at times while I’m left waiting for her reply for up to an hour (if it’s just me and her she’ll reply within a few minutes.) Specifically, the time they were talking is 1:30. The last message I sent before that was at 1:22, the next message she sent to me? 1:59. I get that a relationship doesn’t have to always be communicating constantly throughout the day and I get forgetting to message back immediately but she’s texting him back constantly and I’m left waiting.
So I have a few questions for you all.
1. Is the good morning message him flirting with her, whether it’s knowingly or unknowingly?
2. What do I do about her ignoring me and texting him instead?
3. Am I being paranoid, as she likes to call me or would anyone get upset over something like this?

Oh and final statement:
If I straight up ask her if I could go through her phone she gets super defensive over it and calls me paranoid and abusive. This leads to my fourth and fifth questions.
4. Is the statement true that if she had nothing to hide she’d let me see her messages. (I let her go through my phone and she doesn’t even have to ask me.)

996,8itlc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8itlc8/theres_this_girl/,There's this girl.,"First of all Hello everyone, here we go.
So, there's this girl that i've known since highschool ended. She was my best friends  grilfriend ar the time i've met her through him.
7 years passed and they get married and have a kid.
Now, here comes the interesting part.
Several months ago in August of last year he decided to leave her for another woman. And so he left her Alone with a 5 months old girl and a house in construction(her parents house, they were extending for themselves).

Now here îs where i come.
In about 20 of October last year, i've started talking to her again, after i taught She wouldn't wanna hear from me. You know, cause i was Best feiends with her ex husband to be.
And so in 20 of October, i get to her house, we chat, random stuff, nothing serious, we laugh. And after 7 years in which i knew her as a spoiled girl, as her boyfriend described her, i start to see her as she really îs. A kind hearted, loving woman with a beautiful heart and a beautiful sense of humor, Smart, outgoing, everything i would Ever want in a girl. And so i start talking to her alot, from like 3 times a month, to like 200 Times a day.

And so i Fall for her, we chat alot, She gets even more interesting to me. But then Something happens in December 11 or 12. We go to a club together. First time She went out after a loong time. So we have fun, the night gets shorter. She pulls me away at some point and tells me that She isn't ready for any kind of relationship and that She wants me to stop trying so i don't get Hurt. I've listened to her advice then, because i had no choice in the matter.
After a few days, Christmas came, we gathered a few feiends, we planned it way before we stopped talking alot.

And to my surprize, i start to notice She and some friend of mine are getting a Little too close, and they kind of spend alot of time away of the crowd and together.
And so the next day i confront her and She laughs, telling me i'm mad and that She hasn't even taught about him that way at any point in her life.
I Tell her she's lying i know my gut îs always right, IT never let me down.
I leave it at that, we chat less and less. After a while she stared to talk to me again.(i have to say, she's a virgo and so She values feiendship alot. When se started talking in October, She told me prety much her whole live story. And i was there to listen and She got attched to me in some way, now If we dont talk for a whole day either i know there's Something wrong ore She knows IT and one of us always breaks the silence and talks to solve whatever issue we may have.)
And so 2 months pass. 

2 months in which i know she's with this guy because another friend of mine noticed them and told me(this other friend doesn't know i have feelings for her).
And so i confront her again, She denies again, blatantly lying to my face. This îs when i know She has a problem with lying. She tells lies to protect herself and as She said ""To protect You from getting Hurt, i don't know how bad You could react"".(my first reaftion was actually, i told You so, You are a liar. I hate liars, If You ever lie to me again so blatantly and after i'm the first and the only person to even notice IT from the beginning.)

Some time passes, they have a fight, he breaks up with her in a message. She starts to talk to me again, but this time She made a promise to never lie to me again and be as open to me as She can.
And i've accepted the idea. We start to talk again, i found myself in love with her in like 2 months. Problem îs, She told me this 2 Times already. She sees me like a brother. She couldn't be in a relationship with me, even though we Kiss alot when we're Alone, we Tell eachother stuff that normal friends don't, we get mad ar eachother prety much from any stupid shit, we kind of act like a couple even though we're not one.
She lets me do whatever i want to her. Only thing we haven't done yet îs sex, and that's because she's a full time mom and our lives are a bit complicated and She doesn't want to do it in a hotel room.
Now, what i need from anyone of you is advice. Any rupe, whatever You can Tell me, do îți. How do i make this girl Fall for me more than She already has, and how do i break those feiendship walls that She built?

I asked her to the 8th-grade dance, and she said she wasn't ready for that kind of thing and wanted to go with her friends. Freshman year, I didn't really see or talk to her, and sophomore year, we both had blended learning 7th hour. I put a lot of thought into the way I asked her to the 8th-grade dance, and she brought it up once or twice to mess with me when there were other people there. 

This year (junior year), I've really started talking to her again, and I feel like there's a chance something could happen. We were getting along well, and I would have relatively long conversations on Snapchat every once in a while (that I would always initiate). This girl is very strong and independent, which I respect very much. She isn't a super shy and reserved person. So when she blocked me on Snapchat, I got really worried. I'm not quite sure when it happened. I last messaged her last Saturday (the 5th) and noticed it this past Wednesday when I got home. She seemed off when I passed her during lunch on Wednesday, and when I went up to talk at the end of the hour for a minute, she ignored me at first, then told me she had a test to make up. It felt a little off, but I didn't much of it until I realized we were no longer friends on Snapchat later that day.

I spoke with a good friend about it, who told me to just give it a week and then talk to her about it. A mutual friend between me and the girl who blocked me still talks to me like normal, so I don't think it's something that she has told many people about. This whole thing has me super stressed out because even if a romantic relationship won't work out, I still wanted to be friends at least. I've never had something like this happen to me before. This girl did tell me about a time she told a girl off that was being a jerk to her and her friends, but I honestly can't think of anything I could have done that would have ticked her off like this.

What should I do in order to repair the relationship to a point where I can talk to her? Should I speak to her in person, online, when, and how? Thanks for reading.

(Sorry the explanation is so all over the place. I'll answer any clarifying questions that might help you help me)

Edit: tl;dr been talking to [17/F for a while, suddenly got blocked and not sure what I did. Not the type of person to do this kind of thing.

999,8itdb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8itdb4/clingy_as_hell/,Clingy. As. Hell.,"I have a busy life and this girl i’ve been talking to for a long while is extremely
clingy to the point where talking to her annoys me. She recently moved away for college and everyday its “can i call you” or just unwelcome phone calls right after telling her “hopping in the shower brb” or “at the gym”, etc. i’m not sure what to do. i want to block her on everything and cut that annoyance out of my life but i don’t want to hurt her, as much as i want to bc she annoys the hell out of me with the clinginess and constant phone calls after 9 hour work shifts. 

she’s also very sexual with me and it’s hard to even get turned on by it when she makes everything sexual. 

I’m 19 and she’s 20. what do i do? seriously.
